RPGBENCH: Evaluating Large Language Models as Role-Playing Game Engines,"Pengfei Yu, Dongming Shen, Silin Meng, Jaewon Lee, Weisu Yin, Andrea Yaoyun Cui, Zhenlin Xu, Yi Zhu, Xingjian Shi, Mu Li, Alex Smola",2025-02-01,"We present RPGBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) as text-based role-playing game (RPG) engines. RPGBench comprises two core tasks: Game Creation (GC) and Game Simulation (GS). In GC, an LLM must craft a valid and playable RPG world using a structured event-state representation, ensuring logical coherence and proper termination conditions. In GS, the LLM simulates interactive gameplay across multiple rounds while consistently updating states and enforcing game rules. To comprehensively assess performance, RPGBench integrates objective and subjective evaluation methodologies. Objective measures verify adherence to event mechanics and check variable updates without requiring human intervention. Subjective measures, such as content interestingness, action quality, and role-playing capability, are evaluated via an LLM-as-a-judge framework, where a strong LLM grades each candidate's outputs. Empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can produce engaging stories but often struggle to implement consistent, verifiable game mechanics, particularly in long or complex scenarios. By combining structured, rule-based assessments with LLM-based judgments, RPGBench provides a new standard for evaluating how well LLMs can balance creativity, coherence, and complexity in text-based RPGs, opening avenues for more immersive and controllable interactive storytelling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00595v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
MetaOpenFOAM 2.0: Large Language Model Driven Chain of Thought for Automating CFD Simulation and Post-Processing,"Yuxuan Chen, Xu Zhu, Hua Zhou, Zhuyin Ren",2025-02-01,"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used in aerospace, energy, and biology to model fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed various domains, their application in CFD remains limited, particularly for complex tasks like post-processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaOpenFOAM 2.0, which leverages Chain of Thought (COT) decomposition and iterative verification to enhance accessibility for non-expert users through natural language inputs. Tested on a new benchmark covering simulation (fluid flow, heat transfer, combustion) and post-processing (extraction, visualization), MetaOpenFOAM 2.0 achieved an Executability score of 6.3/7 and a pass rate of 86.9%, significantly outperforming MetaOpenFOAM 1.0 (2.1/7, 0%). Additionally, it proved cost-efficient, averaging $0.15 per case. An ablation study confirmed that COT-driven decomposition and iterative refinement substantially improved task performance. Furthermore, scaling laws showed that increasing COT steps enhanced accuracy while raising token usage, aligning with LLM post-training scaling trends. These results highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating CFD workflows for industrial and research applications.

Doing More with Less -- Implementing Routing Strategies in Large Language Model-Based Systems: An Extended Survey,"Clovis Varangot-Reille, Christophe Bouvard, Antoine Gourru, Mathieu Ciancone, Marion Schaeffer, Fran√ßois Jacquenet",2025-02-01,"Large Language Models (LLM)-based systems, i.e. interconnected elements that include an LLM as a central component (e.g., conversational agents), are typically monolithic static architectures that rely on a single LLM for all user queries. However, they often require different preprocessing strategies, levels of reasoning, or knowledge. Generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) trained on very large multi-topic corpora can perform well in a variety of tasks. They require significant financial, energy, and hardware resources that may not be justified for basic tasks. This implies potentially investing in unnecessary costs for a given query. To overcome this problem, a routing mechanism routes user queries to the most suitable components, such as smaller LLMs or experts in specific topics. This approach may improve response quality while minimising costs. Routing can be expanded to other components of the conversational agent architecture, such as the selection of optimal embedding strategies. This paper explores key considerations for integrating routing into LLM-based systems, focusing on resource management, cost definition, and strategy selection. Our main contributions include a formalisation of the problem, a novel taxonomy of existing approaches emphasising relevance and resource efficiency, and a comparative analysis of these strategies in relation to industry practices. Finally, we identify critical challenges and directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00409v2,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
ALU: Agentic LLM Unlearning,"Debdeep Sanyal, Murari Mandal",2025-02-01,"Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (ALU) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our ALU framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and ALU seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that ALU consistently stands out as the most robust LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring a low constant-time cost. We further highlight ALU's superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, ALU is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00406v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"
CoddLLM: Empowering Large Language Models for Data Analytics,"Jiani Zhang, Hengrui Zhang, Rishav Chakravarti, Yiqun Hu, Patrick Ng, Asterios Katsifodimos, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis, Alon Halevy",2025-02-01,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize data analytics by simplifying tasks such as data discovery and SQL query synthesis through natural language interactions. This work serves as a pivotal first step toward the development of foundation models explicitly designed for data analytics applications. To propel this vision forward, we unveil a new data recipe for post-training LLMs, enhancing their comprehension of data management and empowering them to tackle complex real-world analytics tasks. Specifically, our innovative approach includes a scalable synthetic data generation method that enables the creation of a broad spectrum of topics centered on data representation and manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks that seamlessly bridge tables and text. We show that such tasks can enhance models' understanding of schema creation and the nuanced translation between natural language and tabular data. Leveraging this data recipe, we post-train a new foundation model, named CoddLLM, based on Mistral-NeMo-12B. To assess the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the realm of data analytics, we contribute AnalyticsMMLU, a benchmark containing thousands of multiple-choice questions on databases, data analysis, and machine learning. Our focus on data discovery, has resulted in the contribution of three comprehensive benchmarks that address both database and data lake scenarios. CoddLLM not only excels in performance but also sets a new standard, achieving the highest average accuracy across eight datasets. It outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo on AnalyticsMMLU, exceeding GPT-4o by 12.1% in table selection and showing an average improvement of 24.9% in Text-to-SQL compared to the base model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00329v1,"cs.DB, cs.AI"
"Do LLMs Strategically Reveal, Conceal, and Infer Information? A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game","Mustafa O. Karabag, Ufuk Topcu",2025-01-31,"Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities. Our results point to a weakness of contemporary LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in strategic interactions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19398v1,"cs.AI, cs.GT, cs.LG"
MINDSTORES: Memory-Informed Neural Decision Synthesis for Task-Oriented Reinforcement in Embodied Systems,"Anirudh Chari, Suraj Reddy, Aditya Tiwari, Richard Lian, Brian Zhou",2025-01-31,"While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19318v4,cs.AI

Analysis of LLMs vs Human Experts in Requirements Engineering,"Cory Hymel, Hiroe Johnson",2025-01-31,"The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19297v2,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
Can AI Solve the Peer Review Crisis? A Large Scale Cross Model Experiment of LLMs' Performance and Biases in Evaluating over 1000 Economics Papers,"Pat Pataranutaporn, Nattavudh Powdthavee, Chayapatr Achiwaranguprok, Pattie Maes",2025-01-31,"This study examines the potential of large language models (LLMs) to augment the academic peer review process by reliably evaluating the quality of economics research without introducing systematic bias. We conduct one of the first large-scale experimental assessments of four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemma 3, and LLaMA 3.3) across two complementary experiments. In the first, we use nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over 29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals excluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of AI-generated submissions. The results show that LLMs consistently distinguish between higher- and lower-quality research based solely on textual content, producing quality gradients that closely align with established journal prestige measures. Claude and Gemma perform exceptionally well in capturing these gradients, while GPT excels in detecting AI-generated content. The second experiment comprises 8,910 evaluations designed to assess whether LLMs replicate human like biases in single blind reviews. By systematically varying author gender, institutional affiliation, and academic prominence across 330 papers, we find that GPT, Gemma, and LLaMA assign significantly higher ratings to submissions from top male authors and elite institutions relative to the same papers presented anonymously. These results emphasize the importance of excluding author-identifying information when deploying LLMs in editorial screening. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence and practical guidance for integrating LLMs into peer review to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and promote equity in the publication process of economics research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00070v2,"cs.CY, cs.AI, econ.GN, q-fin.EC"
Survey and Improvement Strategies for Gene Prioritization with Large Language Models,"Matthew Neeley, Guantong Qi, Guanchu Wang, Ruixiang Tang, Dongxue Mao, Chaozhong Liu, Sasidhar Pasupuleti, Bo Yuan, Fan Xia, Pengfei Liu, Zhandong Liu, Xia Hu",2025-01-30,"Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18794v1,"q-bio.GN, cs.AI"
LLM-Generated Heuristics for AI Planning: Do We Even Need Domain-Independence Anymore?,"Alexander Tuisov, Yonatan Vernik, Alexander Shleyfman",2025-01-30,"Domain-independent heuristics have long been a cornerstone of AI planning, offering general solutions applicable across a wide range of tasks without requiring domain-specific engineering.

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation.

A Multi-Layered Large Language Model Framework for Disease Prediction,"Malak Mohamed, Rokaia Emad, Ali Hamdi",2025-01-30,"Social telehealth has revolutionized healthcare by enabling patients to share symptoms and receive medical consultations remotely. Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms, generating a vast repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease classification and symptom severity assessment.

CLoQ: Enhancing Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs via Calibrated LoRA Initialization,"Yanxia Deng, Aozhong Zhang, Naigang Wang, Selcuk Gurses, Zi Yang, Penghang Yin",2025-01-30,"Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18475v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Economic Rationality under Specialization: Evidence of Decision Bias in AI Agents,ShuiDe Wen,2025-01-30,"In the study by Chen et al. (2023) [01], the large language model GPT demonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human level in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this finding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as biotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore whether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent to that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that when agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making behavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as increased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference), decreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision deviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized basic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across multiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization and economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI decision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across various scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18190v2,cs.AI
Large Language Models are Few-shot Multivariate Time Series Classifiers,"Yakun Chen, Zihao Li, Chao Yang, Xianzhi Wang, Guandong Xu",2025-01-30,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively applied in time series analysis. Yet, their utility in the few-shot classification (i.e., a crucial training scenario due to the limited training data available in industrial applications) concerning multivariate time series data remains underexplored. We aim to leverage the extensive pre-trained knowledge in LLMs to overcome the data scarcity problem within multivariate time series. Specifically, we propose LLMFew, an LLM-enhanced framework to investigate the feasibility and capacity of LLMs for few-shot multivariate time series classification. This model introduces a Patch-wise Temporal Convolution Encoder (PTCEnc) to align time series data with the textual embedding input of LLMs. We further fine-tune the pre-trained LLM decoder with Low-rank Adaptations (LoRA) to enhance its feature representation learning ability in time series data. Experimental results show that our model outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, achieving 125.2% and 50.2% improvement in classification accuracy on Handwriting and EthanolConcentration datasets, respectively. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based methods perform well across a variety of datasets in few-shot MTSC, delivering reliable results compared to traditional models.

Self-supervised Quantized Representation for Seamlessly Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models,"Qika Lin, Tianzhe Zhao, Kai He, Zhen Peng, Fangzhi Xu, Ling Huang, Jingying Ma, Mengling Feng",2025-01-30,"Due to the presence of the natural gap between Knowledge Graph (KG) structures and the natural language, the effective integration of holistic structural information of KGs with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant question. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18119v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas,"Pratik S. Sachdeva, Tom van Nuenen",2025-01-30,"The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their encoded moral norms and decision-making processes. Much of this research relies on prompting LLMs with survey-style questions to assess how well models are aligned with certain demographic groups, moral beliefs, or political ideologies. While informative, the adherence of these approaches to relatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and nuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along more detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better assess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this end, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the ""Am I the Asshole"" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on everyday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to assign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We then compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to each other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results demonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral judgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit. LLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model agreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in how models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the complexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and the need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical judgment.

While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore--an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty-driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Results indicate that traditional reasoning-focused LLMs, such as GPT-4o, exhibit a significantly faster and less detailed reasoning process, limiting their exploratory performance. In contrast, the DeepSeek reasoning model demonstrates prolonged, iterative thought processes marked by repetitive analysis of combinations and past trials, reflecting a more thorough and human-like exploration strategy. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18009v2,"cs.AI, q-bio.NC"
Large Language Models for Single-Step and Multi-Step Flight Trajectory Prediction,"Kaiwei Luo, Jiliu Zhou",2025-01-29,"Flight trajectory prediction is a critical time series task in aviation. While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17459v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL"

This integration addresses the critical challenge of limited experimental data in socially assistive robotics for dementia care, providing a dynamic simulation environment that realistically models interactions between persons living with dementia (PLWDs) and robotic caregivers. The proposed framework introduces a probabilistic model to represent the cognitive and emotional states of PLWDs, combined with an LLM-based behavior simulation to emulate their responses. We further develop and train an adaptive RL system enabling humanoid robots, such as Pepper, to deliver context-aware and personalized interactions and assistance based on PLWDs' cognitive and emotional states. The framework also generalizes to computer-based agents, highlighting its versatility. Results demonstrate that the RL system, enhanced by LLMs, effectively interprets and responds to the complex needs of PLWDs, providing tailored caregiving strategies. This research contributes to human-computer and human-robot interaction by offering a customizable AI-driven caregiving platform, advancing understanding of dementia-related challenges, and fostering collaborative innovation in assistive technologies.

FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting,"Zhiyuan Fu, Junfan Chen, Lan Zhang, Ting Yang, Jun Niu, Hongyu Sun, Ruidong Li, Peng Liu, Yuqing Zhang",2025-01-27,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v2,"cs.CR, cs.AI"

Can Large Language Models Be Trusted as Evolutionary Optimizers for Network-Structured Combinatorial Problems?,"Jie Zhao, Tao Wen, Kang Hao Cheong",2025-01-25,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interests in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as active optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary operators as optimizer and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-generated operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLM outputs. Moreover, we develop a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches.

Causal Graphs Meet Thoughts: Enhancing Complex Reasoning in Graph-Augmented LLMs,"Hang Luo, Jian Zhang, Chujun Li",2025-01-24,"In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to provide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs).

Prompt-Based Cost-Effective Evaluation and Operation of ChatGPT as a Computer Programming Teaching Assistant,"Marc Ballestero-Rib√≥, Daniel Ortiz-Mart√≠nez",2025-01-24,"The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques.

MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS,"Bingzheng Gan, Yufan Zhao, Tianyi Zhang, Jing Huang, Yusu Li, Shu Xian Teo, Changwang Zhang, Wei Shi",2025-01-24,"Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, which leads to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot yield an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present the Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication through LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them.

Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes,"Sullam Jeoung, Yubin Ge, Haohan Wang, Jana Diesner",2025-01-24,"Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, e.g., when LLMs fail to operate as intended. This study examines the alignment of LLMs with human values for the domain of politics. Prior research has shown that LLM-generated outputs can include political leanings and mimic the stances of political parties on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions are insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we analyze the factors that contribute to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them. Drawing on findings from cognitive science about representativeness heuristics, i.e., situations where humans lean on representative attributes of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs, we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics' lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs inflate predictions about political parties, which results in stereotyping. We find that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human survey respondents do. Also, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness more than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggesting a potential vulnerability of LLMs that facilitates political stereotyping. We also test prompt-based mitigation strategies, finding that strategies that can mitigate representative heuristics in humans are also effective in reducing the influence of representativeness on LLM-generated responses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14294v3,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
A Comprehensive Framework for Semantic Similarity Analysis of Human and AI-Generated Text Using Transformer Architectures and Ensemble Techniques,"Lifu Gao, Ziwei Liu, Qi Zhang",2025-01-24,"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made detecting AI-generated text an increasingly critical challenge. Traditional methods often fail to capture the nuanced semantic differences between human and machine-generated content. We therefore propose a novel approach based on semantic similarity analysis, leveraging a multi-layered architecture that combines a pre-trained DeBERTa-v3-large model, Bi-directional LSTMs, and linear attention pooling to capture both local and global semantic patterns. To enhance performance, we employ advanced input and output augmentation techniques such as sector-level context integration and wide output configurations. These techniques enable the model to learn more discriminative features and generalize across diverse domains. Experimental results show that this approach works better than traditional methods, proving its usefulness for AI-generated text detection and other text comparison tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14288v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors,"Yi Zhao, Youzhi Zhang",2025-01-24,"Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback (Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

Querying databases is among the most effective of these integrations, enabling LLMs to access private or continually updating data. While Function Calling is the most common method for interfacing external tools to LLMs, its application to database querying as a tool has been underexplored. We propose a tool definition for database querying that unifies accessing data with search queries, filters, or a combination both, as well as transforming results with aggregation and groupby operators. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct a study with 8 LLMs spanning 5 model families. We present a novel pipeline adapting the Gorilla LLM framework to create synthetic database schemas and queries. We primarily evaluate the models with the Exact Match of predicted and ground truth query APIs. Among the models tested, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest performance with an Exact Match score of 74.3%, followed by GPT-4o mini at 73.7%, and GPT-4o at 71.8%. We further breakdown these results per API component utilized and across synthetic use cases. We find that LLMs are highly effective at utilizing operators on boolean properties, but struggle with text property filters. Across use cases we find robust results with the higher performing models such as GPT-4o, but significant performance variance across use cases from lower performing models. We additionally conduct ablation studies exploring the impact of parallel tool calling, adding a rationale as an argument of the tool call, using a separate tool per database collection, and tool calling with structured outputs.

We fine-tuned three open-source LLMs to extract sections using a curated dataset of 487 progress notes, comparing results relative to proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). Internal and external validity were assessed via precision, recall and F1 score. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B outperformed GPT-4o (F1=0.92).

Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery,"Shuzhou Yuan, Michael F√§rber",2025-01-23,"Concerns about hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been raised by researchers, yet their potential in areas where creativity is vital, such as drug discovery, merits exploration. In this paper, we come up with the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. To verify this hypothesis, we use LLMs to describe the SMILES string of molecules in natural language and then incorporate these descriptions as part of the prompt to address specific tasks in drug discovery. Evaluated on seven LLMs and five classification tasks, our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs can achieve better performance with text containing hallucinations. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the baseline without hallucination. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the most consistent improvements across models. Additionally, we conduct empirical analyses and a case study to investigate key factors affecting performance and the underlying reasons.

UGMathBench: A Diverse and Dynamic Benchmark for Undergraduate-Level Mathematical Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Xin Xu, Jiaxin Zhang, Tianhao Chen, Zitong Chao, Jishan Hu, Can Yang",2025-01-23,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities. However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing ""large reasoning models"" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.

Question Answering on Patient Medical Records with Private Fine-Tuned LLMs,"Sara Kothari, Ayush Gupta",2025-01-23,"Healthcare systems continuously generate vast amounts of electronic health records (EHRs), commonly stored in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Despite the wealth of information in these records, their complexity and volume make it difficult for users to retrieve and interpret crucial health insights. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution, enabling semantic question answering (QA) over medical data, allowing users to interact with their health records more effectively. However, ensuring privacy and compliance requires edge and private deployments of LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic QA over EHRs by first identifying the most relevant FHIR resources for a user query (Task1) and subsequently answering the query based on these resources (Task2). We explore the performance of privately hosted, fine-tuned LLMs, evaluating them against benchmark models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, while 250x smaller in size, outperform GPT-4 family models by 0.55% in F1 score on Task1 and 42% on Meteor Task in Task2.

Coarse-to-Fine Process Reward Modeling for Mathematical Reasoning,"Yulan Hu, Ge Chen, Jinman Zhao, Sheng Ouyang, Yong Liu",2025-01-23,"The Process Reward Model (PRM) plays a crucial role in mathematical reasoning tasks, requiring high-quality supervised process data. However, we observe that reasoning steps generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to exhibit strictly incremental information, leading to redundancy that can hinder effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose CFPRM, a simple yet effective coarse-to-fine strategy. Instead of focusing on the detection of redundant steps, our approach first establishes a coarse-grained window to merge adjacent reasoning steps into unified, holistic steps. The window size is then progressively reduced to extract fine-grained reasoning steps, enabling data collection at multiple granularities for training. By leveraging this hierarchical refinement process, CFPRM mitigates redundancy while preserving essential fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two reasoning datasets across three loss criteria validate the CFPRM's effectiveness and versatility.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13622v3,cs.AI
OstQuant: Refining Large Language Model Quantization with Orthogonal and Scaling Transformations for Better Distribution Fitting,"Xing Hu, Yuan Cheng, Dawei Yang, Zukang Xu, Zhihang Yuan, Jiangyong Yu, Chen Xu, Zhe Jiang, Sifan Zhou",2025-01-23,"Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs). The major challenge in LLM quantization is that uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions can expand the quantization range, thereby reducing bit precision for most values. Recent methods attempt to eliminate outliers and balance inter-channel differences by employing linear transformations; however, they remain heuristic and are often overlook optimizing the data distribution across the entire quantization space.In this paper, we introduce Quantization Space Utilization Rate (QSUR), a novel metric that effectively assesses the quantizability of transformed data by measuring the space utilization of the data in the quantization space. We complement QSUR with mathematical derivations that examine the effects and limitations of various transformations, guiding our development of Orthogonal and Scaling Transformation-based Quantization (OSTQuant). OSQuant employs a learnable equivalent transformation, consisting of an orthogonal transformation and a scaling transformation, to optimize the distributions of weights and activations across the entire quantization space. Futhermore, we propose the KL-Top loss function, designed to mitigate noise during optimization while retaining richer semantic information within the limited calibration data imposed by PTQ. OSTQuant outperforms existing work on various LLMs and benchmarks. In the W4-only setting, it retains 99.5\% of the floating-point accuracy.

Full-Stack Optimized Large Language Models for Lifelong Sequential Behavior Comprehension in Recommendation,"Rong Shan, Jiachen Zhu, Jianghao Lin, Chenxu Zhu, Bo Chen, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang",2025-01-23,"In this paper, we address the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem in large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, where LLMs struggle to extract useful information from long user behavior sequences, even within their context limits. To tackle this, we propose ReLLaX (Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models Plus), a framework offering optimization across data, prompt, and parameter levels. At the data level, we introduce Semantic User Behavior Retrieval (SUBR) to reduce sequence heterogeneity, making it easier for LLMs to extract key information. For prompt-level enhancement, we employ Soft Prompt Augmentation (SPA) to inject collaborative knowledge, aligning item representations with recommendation tasks and improving LLMs's exploration of item relationships. Finally, at the parameter level, we propose Component Fully-interactive LoRA (CFLoRA), which enhances LoRA's expressiveness by enabling interactions between its components, allowing better capture of sequential information. Moreover, we present new perspectives to compare current LoRA-based LLM4Rec methods, i.e. from both a composite and a decomposed view. We theoretically demonstrate that the ways they employ LoRA for recommendation are degraded versions of our CFLoRA, with different constraints on atom component interactions.

Harnessing Generative Pre-Trained Transformer for Datacenter Packet Trace Generation,Chen Griner,2025-01-21,"Today, the rapid growth of applications reliant on datacenters calls for new advancements to meet the increasing traffic and computational demands. Traffic traces from datacenters are essential for further development and optimization of future datacenters. However, traces are rarely released to the public. Researchers often use simplified mathematical models that lack the depth needed to recreate intricate traffic patterns and, thus, miss optimization opportunities found in realistic traffic. In this preliminary work, we introduce DTG-GPT, a packet-level Datacenter Traffic Generator (DTG), based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture used by many state-of-the-art large language models. We train our model on a small set of available traffic traces from different domains and offer a simple methodology to evaluate the fidelity of the generated traces to their original counterparts. We show that DTG-GPT can synthesize novel traces that mimic the spatiotemporal patterns found in real traffic traces.

Specifically, the background content of a random variable question (RV question) mirrors the original problem in existing benchmarks, but the variable combinations are randomized, making it ""unseen"" by the LLMs. Models must completely understand the question pattern of the original problem to correctly answer RV questions with various variable values. As a result, the LLM's genuine capability in mathematical reasoning is reflected by its accuracy and robustness on RV-Bench. We conducted extensive experiments on over 30 representative LLMs across more than 1000 RV questions.

Multiplex CoT leverages the power of iterative reasoning, where the model generates an initial chain of thought and subsequently critiques and refines this reasoning with a second round of thought generation. This recursive approach allows for more coherent, logical, and robust answers, improving the overall decision-making process.

Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative Self-Training,"Siyu Yuan, Zehui Chen, Zhiheng Xi, Junjie Ye, Zhengyin Du, Jiecao Chen",2025-01-20,"Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing complex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on enhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such approaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability to recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and expensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique datasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent capabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework, Agent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional methods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages MCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from erroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for timely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address this, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor model identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a failed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct path, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the model to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding better learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this self-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error correction capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that Agent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and enables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments show that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while avoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods (+5.59%).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11425v3,cs.AI

We observe significant variations in distributions of outputs between specific models, and model sub versions, with GPT-4o-Mini-2024-07-18 showing notably better performance (32-43% yes responses) compared to GPT-4-0125-preview's extreme bias (98-99% yes responses). We show that sampling methods and model sub-versions significantly impact results: repeated independent API calls produce different distributions compared to batch sampling within a single call. While no current GPT model can simultaneously achieve a uniform distribution and Markovian properties in one-shot testing, few-shot sampling can approach uniform distributions under certain conditions. We explore the Temperature parameter, providing a definition and comparative results. We further compare our results to true random binary series and test specifically for the common human bias of Negative Recency - finding LLMs have a mixed ability to 'beat' humans in this one regard. These findings emphasise the critical importance of careful LLM integration into ABMs for financial markets and more broadly.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16356v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"
Towards Advancing Code Generation with Large Language Models: A Research Roadmap,"Haolin Jin, Huaming Chen, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu",2025-01-20,"Recently, we have witnessed the rapid development of large language models, which have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the downstream task of code generation. However, despite their potential, LLM-based code generation still faces numerous technical and evaluation challenges, particularly when embedded in real-world development. In this paper, we present our vision for current research directions, and provide an in-depth analysis of existing studies on this task. We propose a six-layer vision framework that categorizes code generation process into distinct phases, namely Input Phase, Orchestration Phase, Development Phase, and Validation Phase. Additionally, we outline our vision workflow, which reflects on the currently prevalent frameworks. We systematically analyse the challenges faced by large language models, including those LLM-based agent frameworks, in code generation tasks. With these, we offer various perspectives and actionable recommendations in this area. Our aim is to provide guidelines for improving the reliability, robustness and usability of LLM-based code generation systems.

The Dual-use Dilemma in LLMs: Do Empowering Ethical Capacities Make a Degraded Utility?,"Yiyi Zhang, Xingyu Chen, Kexin Chen, Yuyang Du, Xilin Dang, Pheng-Ann Heng",2025-01-20,"Recent years have witnessed extensive efforts to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, alongside growing attention to their ethical implications. However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked: LLMs must balance between rejecting harmful requests for safety and accommodating legitimate ones for utility. This paper presents a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based alignment framework that achieves better overall performance by addressing this ethical-utility trade-off, using chemical domain applications as a proof-of-concept. Our alignment pipeline starts with a GPT-assisted three-phase data generation scheme, in which we create LibraChemQA, a chemical question-answering dataset comprising 31.6k triplet instances. By incorporating an innovative balanced seed in the data generation process, our framework systematically considers both legitimate and illegitimate requests. The framework also introduces a rephrasing mechanism for efficient data augmentation that enhances the model's chemical comprehension. We further develop a novel hybrid evaluation scheme with LLM judges for precise assessment of both safety and utility. Experimental results demonstrate our model's substantial improvements in overall performance where both safety and utility are considered - the resulting model outperforms leading LLMs including Claude-3, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3 by margins of 13.44%, 7.16%, and 7.10% respectively on our released benchmark. At the end of this paper, we analyze experimental results obtained from testing DeepSeek-R1 on our benchmark and reveal the critical ethical concerns raised by this highly acclaimed model. We highlight that the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process employed by DeepSeek-R1, as well as other LLMs distilled from it, introduces significant ethical vulnerabilities when exposed to users.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13952v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

Clinical trial cohort selection using Large Language Models on n2c2 Challenges,"Chi-en Amy Tai, Xavier Tannier",2025-01-19,"Clinical trials are a critical process in the medical field for introducing new treatments and innovations. However, cohort selection for clinical trials is a time-consuming process that often requires manual review of patient text records for specific keywords. Though there have been studies on standardizing the information across the various platforms, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools remain crucial for spotting eligibility criteria in textual reports. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for various NLP tasks due to their ability to acquire a nuanced understanding of text. In this paper, we study the performance of large language models on clinical trial cohort selection and leverage the n2c2 challenges to benchmark their performance. Our results are promising with regard to the incorporation of LLMs for simple cohort selection tasks, but also highlight the difficulties encountered by these models as soon as fine-grained knowledge and reasoning are required.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11114v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Dagger Behind Smile: Fool LLMs with a Happy Ending Story,"Xurui Song, Zhixin Xie, Shuo Huai, Jiayi Kong, Jun Luo",2025-01-19,"The wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention from $\textit{jailbreak}$ attacks, where adversarial prompts crafted through optimization or manual design exploit LLMs to generate malicious contents. However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while existing manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to $\textit{positive}$ prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a $\textit{happy ending}$, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request.This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two turns to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79\% attack success rate on average. We also provide quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13115v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CR"
The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs,"Nitay Calderon, Roi Reichart, Rotem Dror",2025-01-19,"The ""LLM-as-an-annotator"" and ""LLM-as-a-judge"" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10970v3,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.HC"

MAPS: Advancing Multi-Modal Reasoning in Expert-Level Physical Science,"Erle Zhu, Yadi Liu, Zhe Zhang, Xujun Li, Jin Zhou, Xinjie Yu, Minlie Huang, Hongning Wang",2025-01-18,"Pre-trained on extensive text and image corpora, current Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLM) have shown strong capabilities in general visual reasoning tasks. However, their performance is still lacking in physical domains that require understanding diagrams with complex physical structures and quantitative analysis based on multi-modal information. To address this, we develop a new framework, named Multi-Modal Scientific Reasoning with Physics Perception and Simulation (MAPS) based on an MLLM. MAPS decomposes expert-level multi-modal reasoning task into physical diagram understanding via a Physical Perception Model (PPM) and reasoning with physical knowledge via a simulator. The PPM module is obtained by fine-tuning a visual language model using carefully designed synthetic data with paired physical diagrams and corresponding simulation language descriptions. At the inference stage, MAPS integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models. The results confirm MAPS offers a promising direction for enhancing multi-modal scientific reasoning ability of MLLMs. We will release our code, model and dataset used for our experiments upon publishing of this paper.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10768v1,cs.AI
Large language models for automated scholarly paper review: A survey,"Zhenzhen Zhuang, Jiandong Chen, Hongfeng Xu, Yuwen Jiang, Jialiang Lin",2025-01-17,"Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society, influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs. In academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts. We proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our previous paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase of ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they also pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for ASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the researchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10326v1,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.DL"

Accelerating Large Language Models through Partially Linear Feed-Forward Network,"Gansen Hu, Zhaoguo Wang, Jinglin Wei, Wei Huang, Haibo Chen",2025-01-17,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face deployment challenges due to their massive parameter counts. While existing compression techniques like pruning can reduce model size, it leads to significant accuracy degradation under high compression ratios. We present a novel perspective inspired by constant folding in compiler optimization. Our approach enables parameter reduction by treating activation functions in LLMs as linear functions. However, recent LLMs use complex non-linear activations like GELU that prevent direct application of this technique. We propose TARDIS, which enables optimization of LLMs with non-linear activations by partially approximating them with linear functions in frequently occurring input ranges. For outlier inputs, TARDIS employs an online predictor to dynamically fall back to original computations. Our experiments demonstrate that TARDIS achieves 80% parameter reduction in feed-forward networks, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art pruning methods Wanda and RIA with up to 65% higher accuracy. In practical deployments for a 7B model, TARDIS achieves 1.6x end-to-end inference speedup when integrated with the vLLM serving system, and 1.4x speedup with the widely adopted HuggingFace implementation, while incurring only a 10.9% accuracy trade-off.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10054v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, D.4; I.2; D.3.4"
AirRAG: Activating Intrinsic Reasoning for Retrieval Augmented Generation using Tree-based Search,"Wenfeng Feng, Chuzhan Hao, Yuewei Zhang, Jingyi Song, Hao Wang",2025-01-17,"Leveraging the autonomous decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated superior performance in reasoning tasks. However, despite the success of iterative or recursive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, these methods are often constrained to a single solution space when confronted with complex problems. In this paper, we propose a novel thinking pattern in RAG that integrates system analysis with efficient reasoning actions, significantly activating intrinsic reasoning capabilities and expanding the solution space of specific tasks via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which we refer to as AirRAG. Specifically, our approach designs five fundamental reasoning actions, which are expanded to a broad tree-based reasoning space using MCTS. The approach also incorporates self-consistency verification to explore potential reasoning paths and inference scaling law. Additionally, computationally optimal strategies are employed to allocate more inference resources to key actions, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AirRAG, showing significant performance gains on complex question-answering datasets.

Attention-guided Self-reflection for Zero-shot Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models,"Qiang Liu, Xinlong Chen, Yue Ding, Shizhen Xu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang",2025-01-17,"Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09997v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Towards A Litmus Test for Common Sense,Hugo Latapie,2025-01-17,"This paper is the second in a planned series aimed at envisioning a path to safe and beneficial artificial intelligence. Building on the conceptual insights of ""Common Sense Is All You Need,"" we propose a more formal litmus test for common sense, adopting an axiomatic approach that combines minimal prior knowledge (MPK) constraints with diagonal or Godel-style arguments to create tasks beyond the agent's known concept set. We discuss how this approach applies to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), acknowledging training/test data constraints, physical or virtual embodiment, and large language models (LLMs). We also integrate observations regarding emergent deceptive hallucinations, in which more capable AI systems may intentionally fabricate plausible yet misleading outputs to disguise knowledge gaps. The overarching theme is that scaling AI without ensuring common sense risks intensifying such deceptive tendencies, thereby undermining safety and trust. Aligning with the broader goal of developing beneficial AI without causing harm, our axiomatic litmus test not only diagnoses whether an AI can handle truly novel concepts but also provides a stepping stone toward an ethical, reliable foundation for future safe, beneficial, and aligned artificial intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09913v1,cs.AI

To address this, we propose a novel causal reward modeling approach that integrates causality to mitigate these spurious correlations. Our method enforces counterfactual invariance, ensuring reward predictions remain consistent when irrelevant variables are altered. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our approach mitigates various types of spurious correlations effectively, resulting in more reliable and fair alignment of LLMs with human preferences.

We start by looking at the challenges and progress in making large language models (LLMs) more transparent, inclusive, and aware of social biases. Even though LLMs like ChatGPT have impressive abilities, they struggle to understand different cultural contexts and engage in meaningful, human like conversations. A key issue is that biases in language processing, especially in machine translation, can reinforce inequality. Tackling these biases requires a multidisciplinary approach to ensure AI promotes diversity, fairness, and inclusion. We also highlight AI's role in identifying biased content in media, which is important for improving representation. By detecting unequal portrayals of social groups, AI can help challenge stereotypes and create more inclusive technologies. Transparent AI algorithms, which clearly explain their decisions, are essential for building trust and reducing bias in AI systems. We also stress AI systems need diverse and inclusive training data. Projects like the Child Growth Monitor show how using a wide range of data can help address real world problems like malnutrition and poverty. We present a project that demonstrates how AI can be applied to monitor the role of search engines in spreading disinformation about the LGBTQ+ community. Moreover, we discuss the SignON project as an example of how technology can bridge communication gaps between hearing and deaf people, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and mutual trust in developing inclusive AI.

Perspective Transition of Large Language Models for Solving Subjective Tasks,"Xiaolong Wang, Yuanchi Zhang, Ziyue Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Fuwen Luo, Yile Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu",2025-01-16,"Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling remarkable progress in various tasks. Different from objective tasks such as commonsense reasoning and arithmetic question-answering, the performance of LLMs on subjective tasks is still limited, where the perspective on the specific problem plays crucial roles for better interpreting the context and giving proper response. For example, in certain scenarios, LLMs may perform better when answering from an expert role perspective, potentially eliciting their relevant domain knowledge. In contrast, in some scenarios, LLMs may provide more accurate responses when answering from a third-person standpoint, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potentially mitigating inherent biases.

Decompose-ToM: Enhancing Theory of Mind Reasoning in Large Language Models through Simulation and Task Decomposition,"Sneheel Sarangi, Maha Elgarf, Hanan Salam",2025-01-15,"Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand and reflect on the mental states of others.

Although the most capable closed-source LLMs have come close to human performance on some ToM tasks, they still perform poorly on complex variations of the task that involve more structured reasoning. In this work, we utilize the concept of ""pretend-play"", or ``Simulation Theory'' from cognitive psychology to propose ``Decompose-ToM'': an LLM-based inference algorithm that improves model performance on complex ToM tasks. We recursively simulate user perspectives and decompose the ToM task into a simpler set of functions: subject identification, question-reframing, world model updation, and knowledge availability. We test the algorithm on higher-order ToM tasks and a task testing for ToM capabilities in a conversational setting, demonstrating that our approach shows significant improvement across models compared to baseline methods while requiring minimal prompt tuning across tasks and no additional model training.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09056v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

Ebby, Jillian Gorskic, Matthew Kalscheur, Samy Khalil, Marie Pisani, Tyler Rubeor, Peter Stetson, Frank Liao, Cherodeep Goswami, Brian Patterson, Majid Afshar",2025-01-15,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) workflows, validated instruments are essential to evaluate their performance before implementation. Existing instruments for provider documentation quality are often unsuitable for the complexities of LLM-generated text and lack validation on real-world data. The Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument (PDSQI-9) was developed to evaluate LLM-generated clinical summaries. Multi-document summaries were generated from real-world EHR data across multiple specialties using several LLMs (GPT-4o, Mixtral 8x7b, and Llama 3-8b). Validation included Pearson correlation for substantive validity, factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha for structural validity, inter-rater reliability (ICC and Krippendorff's alpha) for generalizability, a semi-Delphi process for content validity, and comparisons of high-versus low-quality summaries for discriminant validity. Seven physician raters evaluated 779 summaries and answered 8,329 questions, achieving over 80% power for inter-rater reliability. The PDSQI-9 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.879; 95% CI: 0.867-0.891) and high inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.867; 95% CI: 0.867-0.868), supporting structural validity and generalizability. Factor analysis identified a 4-factor model explaining 58% of the variance, representing organization, clarity, accuracy, and utility. Substantive validity was supported by correlations between note length and scores for Succinct (rho = -0.200, p = 0.029) and Organized ($\rho = -0.190$, $p = 0.037$). Discriminant validity distinguished high- from low-quality summaries ($p < 0.001$). The PDSQI-9 demonstrates robust construct validity, supporting its use in clinical practice to evaluate LLM-generated summaries and facilitate safer integration of LLMs into healthcare workflows.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08977v2,cs.AI
Analyzing the Ethical Logic of Six Large Language Models,"W. Russell Neuman, Chad Coleman, Manan Shah",2025-01-15,"This study examines the ethical reasoning of six prominent generative large language models: OpenAI GPT-4o, Meta LLaMA 3.1, Perplexity, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini, and Mistral 7B. The research explores how these models articulate and apply ethical logic, particularly in response to moral dilemmas such as the Trolley Problem, and Heinz Dilemma. Departing from traditional alignment studies, the study adopts an explainability-transparency framework, prompting models to explain their ethical reasoning. This approach is analyzed through three established ethical typologies: the consequentialist-deontological analytic, Moral Foundations Theory, and the Kohlberg Stages of Moral Development Model. Findings reveal that LLMs exhibit largely convergent ethical logic, marked by a rationalist, consequentialist emphasis, with decisions often prioritizing harm minimization and fairness. Despite similarities in pre-training and model architecture, a mixture of nuanced and significant differences in ethical reasoning emerge across models, reflecting variations in fine-tuning and post-training processes. The models consistently display erudition, caution, and self-awareness, presenting ethical reasoning akin to a graduate-level discourse in moral philosophy. In striking uniformity these systems all describe their ethical reasoning as more sophisticated than what is characteristic of typical human moral logic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08951v1,"cs.AI, cs.CY"
Automated Retrosynthesis Planning of Macromolecules Using Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs,"Qinyu Ma, Yuhao Zhou, Jianfeng Li",2025-01-15,"Identifying reliable synthesis pathways in materials chemistry is a complex task, particularly in polymer science, due to the intricate and often non-unique nomenclature of macromolecules. To address this challenge, we propose an agent system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. By leveraging LLMs' powerful capabilities for extracting and recognizing chemical substance names, and storing the extracted data in a structured knowledge graph, our system fully automates the retrieval of relevant literatures, extraction of reaction data, database querying, construction of retrosynthetic pathway trees, further expansion through the retrieval of additional literature and recommendation of optimal reaction pathways. By considering the complex interdependencies among chemical reactants, a novel Multi-branched Reaction Pathway Search Algorithm (MBRPS) is proposed to help identify all valid multi-branched reaction pathways, which arise when a single product decomposes into multiple reaction intermediates. In contrast, previous studies were limited to cases where a product decomposes into at most one reaction intermediate. This work represents the first attempt to develop a fully automated retrosynthesis planning agent tailored specially for macromolecules powered by LLMs. Applied to polyimide synthesis, our new approach constructs a retrosynthetic pathway tree with hundreds of pathways and recommends optimized routes, including both known and novel pathways. This demonstrates utilizing LLMs for literature consultation to accomplish specific tasks is possible and crucial for future materials research, given the vast amount of materials-related literature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08897v2,cs.AI

In this work, we address this gap by developing an Arabic LJP dataset, collected and preprocessed from Saudi commercial court judgments. We benchmark state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-3.2-3B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, under varying configurations such as zero-shot, one-shot, and fine-tuning using LoRA.

LlamaRestTest: Effective REST API Testing with Small Language Models,"Myeongsoo Kim, Saurabh Sinha, Alessandro Orso",2025-01-15,"Modern web services rely heavily on REST APIs, typically documented using the OpenAPI specification. The widespread adoption of this standard has resulted in the development of many black-box testing tools that generate tests based on OpenAPI specifications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising test-generation abilities, their application to REST API testing remains mostly unexplored. We present LlamaRestTest, a novel approach that employs two custom LLMs-created by fine-tuning and quantizing the Llama3-8B model using mined datasets of REST API example values and inter-parameter dependencies-to generate realistic test inputs and uncover inter-parameter dependencies during the testing process by analyzing server responses. We evaluated LlamaRestTest on 12 real-world services (including popular services such as Spotify), comparing it against RESTGPT, a GPT-powered specification-enhancement tool, as well as several state-of-the-art REST API testing tools, including RESTler, MoRest, EvoMaster, and ARAT-RL. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning enables smaller models to outperform much larger models in detecting actionable parameter-dependency rules and generating valid inputs for REST API testing. We also evaluated different tool configurations, ranging from the base Llama3-8B model to fine-tuned versions, and explored multiple quantization techniques, including 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit integer formats. Our study shows that small language models can perform as well as, or better than, large language models in REST API testing, balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, LlamaRestTest outperforms state-of-the-art REST API testing tools in code coverage achieved and internal server errors identified, even when those tools use RESTGPT-enhanced specifications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08598v2,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them,"Abhilasha Ravichander, Shrusti Ghela, David Wadden, Yejin Choi",2025-01-14,"Despite their impressive ability to generate high-quality and fluent text, generative large language models (LLMs) also produce hallucinations: statements that are misaligned with established world knowledge or provided input context. However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors). We hope our framework provides a foundation to enable the principled study of why generative models hallucinate, and advances the development of trustworthy large language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
I Can Find You in Seconds! Leveraging Large Language Models for Code Authorship Attribution,"Soohyeon Choi, Yong Kiam Tan, Mark Huasong Meng, Mohamed Ragab, Soumik Mondal, David Mohaisen, Khin Mi Mi Aung",2025-01-14,"Source code authorship attribution is important in software forensics, plagiarism detection, and protecting software patch integrity. Existing techniques often rely on supervised machine learning, which struggles with generalization across different programming languages and coding styles due to the need for large labeled datasets. Inspired by recent advances in natural language authorship analysis using large language models (LLMs), which have shown exceptional performance without task-specific tuning, this paper explores the use of LLMs for source code authorship attribution. We present a comprehensive study demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully attribute source code authorship across different languages. LLMs can determine whether two code snippets are written by the same author with zero-shot prompting, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.78, and can attribute code authorship from a small set of reference code snippets via few-shot learning, achieving MCC of 0.77. Additionally, LLMs show some adversarial robustness against misattribution attacks. Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not scale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations. To address this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale attribution. Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355 samples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve classification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one reference per author.

Exploring Narrative Clustering in Large Language Models: A Layerwise Analysis of BERT,"Awritrojit Banerjee, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss",2025-01-14,"This study investigates the internal mechanisms of BERT, a transformer-based large language model, with a focus on its ability to cluster narrative content and authorial style across its layers. Using a dataset of narratives developed via GPT-4, featuring diverse semantic content and stylistic variations, we analyze BERT's layerwise activations to uncover patterns of localized neural processing. Through dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), we reveal that BERT exhibits strong clustering based on narrative content in its later layers, with progressively compact and distinct clusters. While strong stylistic clustering might occur when narratives are rephrased into different text types (e.g., fables, sci-fi, kids' stories), minimal clustering is observed for authorial style specific to individual writers. These findings highlight BERT's prioritization of semantic content over stylistic features, offering insights into its representational capabilities and processing hierarchy.

However, while full fine-tuning delivers superior results, it entails significant computational and resource costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, address these challenges by reducing the number of trainable parameters, but they often struggle with rank adjustment efficiency and task-specific adaptability. We propose Triangular Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (TriAdaptLoRA), a novel PEFT framework inspired by neuroscience principles, which dynamically optimizes the allocation of trainable parameters. TriAdaptLoRA introduces three key innovations: 1) a triangular split of transformation matrices into lower and upper triangular components to maximize parameter utilization, 2) a parameter importance metric based on normalized Frobenius norms for efficient adaptation, and 3) an adaptive rank-growth strategy governed by dynamic thresholds, allowing flexible parameter allocation across training steps. Experiments conducted on a variety of natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that TriAdaptLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods. It achieves superior performance, enhanced stability, and reduced computational overhead, particularly under linear threshold-driven rank growth.

Advice for Diabetes Self-Management by ChatGPT Models: Challenges and Recommendations,"Waqar Hussain, John Grundy",2025-01-14,"Given their ability for advanced reasoning, extensive contextual understanding, and robust question-answering abilities, large language models have become prominent in healthcare management research. Despite adeptly handling a broad spectrum of healthcare inquiries, these models face significant challenges in delivering accurate and practical advice for chronic conditions such as diabetes. We evaluate the responses of ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4 to diabetes patient queries, assessing their depth of medical knowledge and their capacity to deliver personalized, context-specific advice for diabetes self-management. Our findings reveal discrepancies in accuracy and embedded biases, emphasizing the models' limitations in providing tailored advice unless activated by sophisticated prompting techniques. Additionally, we observe that both models often provide advice without seeking necessary clarification, a practice that can result in potentially dangerous advice. This underscores the limited practical effectiveness of these models without human oversight in clinical settings. To address these issues, we propose a commonsense evaluation layer for prompt evaluation and incorporating disease-specific external memory using an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation technique.

Large Language Models for Interpretable Mental Health Diagnosis,"Brian Hyeongseok Kim, Chao Wang",2025-01-13,"We propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for mental health diagnosis that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and constraint logic programming (CLP). Having a CDSS is important because of the high complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and the danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM to translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using an off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded rules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect the LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS ensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We experimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs: diagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated logic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs are extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs still require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to the official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the direct use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid approach like our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07653v2,"cs.AI, cs.LO"

This letter introduces SafePowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLM)s. The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. SafePowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07639v1,cs.AI

Initial Findings on Sensor based Open Vocabulary Activity Recognition via Text Embedding Inversion,"Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz",2025-01-13,"Conventional human activity recognition (HAR) relies on classifiers trained to predict discrete activity classes, inherently limiting recognition to activities explicitly present in the training set. Such classifiers would invariably fail, putting zero likelihood, when encountering unseen activities. We propose Open Vocabulary HAR (OV-HAR), a framework that overcomes this limitation by first converting each activity into natural language and breaking it into a sequence of elementary motions. This descriptive text is then encoded into a fixed-size embedding. The model is trained to regress this embedding, which is subsequently decoded back into natural language using a pre-trained embedding inversion model. Unlike other works that rely on auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) at their core, OV-HAR achieves open vocabulary recognition without the computational overhead of such models. The generated text can be transformed into a single activity class using LLM prompt engineering. We have evaluated our approach on different modalities, including vision (pose), IMU, and pressure sensors, demonstrating robust generalization across unseen activities and modalities, offering a fundamentally different paradigm from contemporary classifiers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07408v1,cs.AI
LLM-Net: Democratizing LLMs-as-a-Service through Blockchain-based Expert Networks,"Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng",2025-01-13,"The centralization of Large Language Models (LLMs) development has created significant barriers to AI advancement, limiting the democratization of these powerful technologies. This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs. While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information. This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers. By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms. The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery.

Breaking Memory Limits: Gradient Wavelet Transform Enhances LLMs Training,"Ziqing Wen, Ping Luo, Jiahuan Wang, Xiaoge Deng, Jinping Zou, Kun Yuan, Tao Sun, Dongsheng Li",2025-01-13,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, their vast number of parameters introduces significant memory challenges during training, particularly when using memory-intensive optimizers like Adam. Existing memory-efficient algorithms often rely on techniques such as singular value decomposition projection or weight freezing. While these approaches help alleviate memory constraints, they generally produce suboptimal results compared to full-rank updates. In this paper, we investigate the memory-efficient method beyond low-rank training, proposing a novel solution called Gradient Wavelet Transform (GWT), which applies wavelet transforms to gradients in order to significantly reduce the memory requirements for maintaining optimizer states. We demonstrate that GWT can be seamlessly integrated with memory-intensive optimizers, enabling efficient training without sacrificing performance.

How GPT learns layer by layer,"Jason Du, Kelly Hong, Alishba Imran, Erfan Jahanparast, Mehdi Khfifi, Kaichun Qiao",2025-01-13,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks like language processing, strategy games, and reasoning but struggle to build generalizable internal representations essential for adaptive decision-making in agents. For agents to effectively navigate complex environments, they must construct reliable world models. While LLMs perform well on specific benchmarks, they often fail to generalize, leading to brittle representations that limit their real-world effectiveness. Understanding how LLMs build internal world models is key to developing agents capable of consistent, adaptive behavior across tasks. We analyze OthelloGPT, a GPT-based model trained on Othello gameplay, as a controlled testbed for studying representation learning. Despite being trained solely on next-token prediction with random valid moves, OthelloGPT shows meaningful layer-wise progression in understanding board state and gameplay. Early layers capture static attributes like board edges, while deeper layers reflect dynamic tile changes. To interpret these representations, we compare Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) with linear probes, finding that SAEs offer more robust, disentangled insights into compositional features, whereas linear probes mainly detect features useful for classification. We use SAEs to decode features related to tile color and tile stability, a previously unexamined feature that reflects complex gameplay concepts like board control and long-term planning. We study the progression of linear probe accuracy and tile color using both SAE's and linear probes to compare their effectiveness at capturing what the model is learning. Although we begin with a smaller language model, OthelloGPT, this study establishes a framework for understanding the internal representations learned by GPT models, transformers, and LLMs more broadly.

However, there still lack evaluations of LLMs values that fulfill three desirable goals. (1) Value Clarification: We expect to clarify the underlying values of LLMs precisely and comprehensively, while current evaluations focus narrowly on safety risks such as bias and toxicity. (2) Evaluation Validity: Existing static, open-source benchmarks are prone to data contamination and quickly become obsolete as LLMs evolve. Additionally, these discriminative evaluations uncover LLMs' knowledge about values, rather than valid assessments of LLMs' behavioral conformity to values.

PoAct: Policy and Action Dual-Control Agent for Generalized Applications,"Guozhi Yuan, Youfeng Liu, Jingli Yang, Wei Jia, Kai Lin, Yansong Gao, Shan He, Zilin Ding, Haitao Li",2025-01-13,"Based on their superior comprehension and reasoning capabilities, Large Language Model (LLM) driven agent frameworks have achieved significant success in numerous complex reasoning tasks. ReAct-like agents can solve various intricate problems step-by-step through progressive planning and tool calls, iteratively optimizing new steps based on environmental feedback. However, as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve, the actions invoked by tool calls in ReAct-like frameworks often misalign with complex planning and challenging data organization. Code Action addresses these issues while also introducing the challenges of a more complex action space and more difficult action organization. To leverage Code Action and tackle the challenges of its complexity, this paper proposes Policy and Action Dual-Control Agent (PoAct) for generalized applications. The aim is to achieve higher-quality code actions and more accurate reasoning paths by dynamically switching reasoning policies and modifying the action space.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising approach, but their application in Arabic contexts faces challenges including limited labeled datasets, linguistic complexity, and translation biases. This study comprehensively evaluates 8 LLMs, including general multi-lingual models, as well as bi-lingual ones, on diverse mental health datasets (such as AraDepSu, Dreaddit, MedMCQA), investigating the impact of prompt design, language configuration (native Arabic vs. translated English, and vice versa), and few-shot prompting on diagnostic performance. We find that prompt engineering significantly influences LLM scores mainly due to reduced instruction following, with our structured prompt outperforming a less structured variant on multi-class datasets, with an average difference of 14.5\%. While language influence on performance was modest, model selection proved crucial: Phi-3.5 MoE excelled in balanced accuracy, particularly for binary classification, while Mistral NeMo showed superior performance in mean absolute error for severity prediction tasks. Few-shot prompting consistently improved performance, with particularly substantial gains observed for GPT-4o Mini on multi-class classification, boosting accuracy by an average factor of 1.58.

Towards a Probabilistic Framework for Analyzing and Improving LLM-Enabled Software,"Juan Manuel Baldonado, Flavia Bonomo-Braberman, V√≠ctor Adri√°n Braberman",2025-01-10,"Ensuring the reliability and verifiability of large language model (LLM)-enabled systems remains a significant challenge in software engineering. We propose a probabilistic framework for systematically analyzing and improving these systems by modeling and refining distributions over clusters of semantically equivalent outputs. This framework facilitates the evaluation and iterative improvement of Transference Models--key software components that utilize LLMs to transform inputs into outputs for downstream tasks. To illustrate its utility, we apply the framework to the autoformalization problem, where natural language documentation is transformed into formal program specifications. Our case illustrates how distribution-aware analysis enables the identification of weaknesses and guides focused alignment improvements, resulting in more reliable and interpretable outputs. This principled approach offers a foundation for addressing critical challenges in the development of robust LLM-enabled systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06370v2,"cs.SE, cs.AI, D.2.5; D.2.4; I.2.7"
Gender-Neutral Large Language Models for Medical Applications: Reducing Bias in PubMed Abstracts,"Elizabeth Schaefer, Kirk Roberts",2025-01-10,"This paper presents a pipeline for mitigating gender bias in large language models (LLMs) used in medical literature by neutralizing gendered occupational pronouns. A dataset of 379,000 PubMed abstracts from 1965-1980 was processed to identify and modify pronouns tied to professions. We developed a BERT-based model, ""Modern Occupational Bias Elimination with Refined Training,"" or ""MOBERT,"" trained on these neutralized abstracts, and compared its performance with ""1965BERT,"" trained on the original dataset. MOBERT achieved a 70% inclusive replacement rate, while 1965BERT reached only 4%. A further analysis of MOBERT revealed that pronoun replacement accuracy correlated with the frequency of occupational terms in the training data. We propose expanding the dataset and refining the pipeline to improve performance and ensure more equitable language modeling in medical applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06365v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR"
Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms: A Survey of LLMs,"Khanh-Tung Tran, Dung Dao, Minh-Duong Nguyen, Quoc-Viet Pham, Barry O'Sullivan, Hoang D. Nguyen",2025-01-10,"With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI has become phenomenal in real-world applications, moving toward multiple LLM-based agents to perceive, learn, reason, and act collaboratively. These LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) enable groups of intelligent agents to coordinate and solve complex tasks collectively at scale, transitioning from isolated models to collaboration-centric approaches. This work provides an extensive survey of the collaborative aspect of MASs and introduces an extensible framework to guide future research. Our framework characterizes collaboration mechanisms based on key dimensions: actors (agents involved), types (e.g., cooperation, competition, or coopetition), structures (e.g., peer-to-peer, centralized, or distributed), strategies (e.g., role-based or model-based), and coordination protocols. Through a review of existing methodologies, our findings serve as a foundation for demystifying and advancing LLM-based MASs toward more intelligent and collaborative solutions for complex, real-world use cases. In addition, various applications of MASs across diverse domains, including 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, question answering, and social and cultural settings, are also investigated, demonstrating their wider adoption and broader impacts.

Bactrainus: Optimizing Large Language Models for Multi-hop Complex Question Answering Tasks,"Iman Barati, Arash Ghafouri, Behrouz Minaei-Bidgoli",2025-01-10,"In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased, and these models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of general language tasks. However, the evaluation of their performance in domain-specific tasks, particularly those requiring deep natural language understanding, has received less attention. In this research, we evaluate the ability of large language models in performing domain-specific tasks, focusing on the multi-hop question answering (MHQA) problem using the HotpotQA dataset. This task, due to its requirement for reasoning and combining information from multiple textual sources, serves as a challenging benchmark for assessing the language comprehension capabilities of these models. To tackle this problem, we have designed a two-stage selector-reader architecture, where each stage utilizes an independent LLM. In addition, methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and question decomposition have been employed to investigate their impact on improving the model's performance. The results of the study show that the integration of large language models with these techniques can lead to up to a 4% improvement in F1 score for finding answers, providing evidence of the models' ability to handle domain-specific tasks and their understanding of complex language.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06286v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Iconicity in Large Language Models,"Anna Marklov√°, Ji≈ô√≠ Miliƒçka, Leonid Ryvkin, ƒΩudmila Lackov√° Bennet, Libu≈°e Korman√≠kov√°",2025-01-10,"Lexical iconicity, a direct relation between a word's meaning and its form, is an important aspect of every natural language, most commonly manifesting through sound-meaning associations. Since Large language models' (LLMs') access to both meaning and sound of text is only mediated (meaning through textual context, sound through written representation, further complicated by tokenization), we might expect that the encoding of iconicity in LLMs would be either insufficient or significantly different from human processing. This study addresses this hypothesis by having GPT-4 generate highly iconic pseudowords in artificial languages. To verify that these words actually carry iconicity, we had their meanings guessed by Czech and German participants (n=672) and subsequently by LLM-based participants (generated by GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The results revealed that humans can guess the meanings of pseudowords in the generated iconic language more accurately than words in distant natural languages and that LLM-based participants are even more successful than humans in this task. This core finding is accompanied by several additional analyses concerning the universality of the generated language and the cues that both human and LLM-based participants utilize.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05643v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

Recurrent LLM (R-LLM) architectures have proven effective in mitigating the quadratic complexity of self-attention, making them a potential paradigm for computing on-edge neuromorphic processors. In this work, we propose a low-cost, training-free algorithm to sparsify R-LLMs' activations to enhance energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent structure of these models, rendering them well-suited for energy-constrained environments. Although primarily designed for R-LLMs, this method can be generalized to other LLM architectures, such as transformers, as demonstrated on the OPT model, achieving comparable sparsity and efficiency improvements. Empirical studies illustrate that our method significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining competitive accuracy across multiple zero-shot learning benchmarks.

RAG-WM: An Efficient Black-Box Watermarking Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models,"Peizhuo Lv, Mengjie Sun, Hao Wang, Xiaofeng Wang, Shengzhi Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Kai Chen, Limin Sun",2025-01-09,"In recent years, tremendous success has been witnessed in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific, knowledge-intensive, and privacy-sensitive tasks. However, attackers may steal those valuable RAGs and deploy or commercialize them, making it essential to detect Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. Most existing ownership protection solutions, such as watermarks, are designed for relational databases and texts. They cannot be directly applied to RAGs because relational database watermarks require white-box access to detect IP infringement, which is unrealistic for the knowledge base in RAGs. Meanwhile, post-processing by the adversary's deployed LLMs typically destructs text watermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box ""knowledge watermark"" approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of RAGs. RAG-WM uses a multi-LLM interaction framework, comprising a Watermark Generator, Shadow LLM & RAG, and Watermark Discriminator, to create watermark texts based on watermark entity-relationship tuples and inject them into the target RAG. We evaluate RAG-WM across three domain-specific and two privacy-sensitive tasks on four benchmark LLMs. Experimental results show that RAG-WM effectively detects the stolen RAGs in various deployed LLMs. Furthermore, RAG-WM is robust against paraphrasing, unrelated content removal, knowledge insertion, and knowledge expansion attacks. Lastly, RAG-WM can also evade watermark detection approaches, highlighting its promising application in detecting IP infringement of RAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05249v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"
Analyzing Memorization in Large Language Models through the Lens of Model Attribution,"Tarun Ram Menta, Susmit Agrawal, Chirag Agarwal",2025-01-09,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are prevalent in modern applications but often memorize training data, leading to privacy breaches and copyright issues. Existing research has mainly focused on posthoc analyses, such as extracting memorized content or developing memorization metrics, without exploring the underlying architectural factors that contribute to memorization. In this work, we investigate memorization from an architectural lens by analyzing how attention modules at different layers impact its memorization and generalization performance. Using attribution techniques, we systematically intervene in the LLM architecture by bypassing attention modules at specific blocks while keeping other components like layer normalization and MLP transformations intact. We provide theorems analyzing our intervention mechanism from a mathematical view, bounding the difference in layer outputs with and without our attributions. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that attention modules in deeper transformer blocks are primarily responsible for memorization, whereas earlier blocks are crucial for the models generalization and reasoning capabilities. We validate our findings through comprehensive experiments on different LLM families (Pythia and GPTNeo) and five benchmark datasets. Our insights offer a practical approach to mitigate memorization in LLMs while preserving their performance, contributing to safer and more ethical deployment in real world applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05078v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI"

Evaluating their true `understanding' of language is particularly challenging due to the extensive web-scale data they are trained on. Therefore, we construct an evaluation to systematically assess natural language understanding (NLU) in LLMs by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG), which provides insights into the meaning captured by linguistic elements known as constructions (Cxns). CxG is well-suited for this purpose because provides a theoretical basis to construct targeted evaluation sets. These datasets are carefully constructed to include examples which are unlikely to appear in pre-training data, yet intuitive and easy for humans to understand, enabling a more targeted and reliable assessment. Our experiments focus on downstream natural language inference and reasoning tasks by comparing LLMs' understanding of the underlying meanings communicated through 8 unique Cxns with that of humans. The results show that while LLMs demonstrate some knowledge of constructional information, even the latest models including GPT-o1 struggle with abstract meanings conveyed by these Cxns, as demonstrated in cases where test sentences are dissimilar to their pre-training data.

CALM: Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models,"Xiang Zheng, Longxiang Wang, Yi Liu, Xingjun Ma, Chao Shen, Cong Wang",2025-01-06,"Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial and challenging task. In this study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their parameters, only to the provided service. We treat this type of auditing as a black-box optimization problem where the goal is to automatically uncover input-output pairs of the target LLMs that exhibit illegal, immoral, or unsafe behaviors. For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM responds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative response from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals. This black-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points, the discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address these challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to finetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased input-output pairs of the target LLM.

KG-CF: Knowledge Graph Completion with Context Filtering under the Guidance of Large Language Models,"Zaiyi Zheng, Yushun Dong, Song Wang, Haochen Liu, Qi Wang, Jundong Li",2025-01-06,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various tasks, including knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, current studies mostly apply LLMs to classification tasks, like identifying missing triplets, rather than ranking-based tasks, where the model ranks candidate entities based on plausibility. This focus limits the practical use of LLMs in KGC, as real-world applications prioritize highly plausible triplets. Additionally, while graph paths can help infer the existence of missing triplets and improve completion accuracy, they often contain redundant information. To address these issues, we propose KG-CF, a framework tailored for ranking-based KGC tasks. KG-CF leverages LLMs' reasoning abilities to filter out irrelevant contexts, achieving superior results on real-world datasets.

EAGLE: Enhanced Visual Grounding Minimizes Hallucinations in Instructional Multimodal Models,"Andr√©s Villa, Juan Le√≥n Alc√°zar, Motasem Alfarra, Vladimir Araujo, Alvaro Soto, Bernard Ghanem",2025-01-06,"Large language models and vision transformers have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities, enabling significant transferability in downstream tasks. The fusion of these models has resulted in multi-modal architectures with enhanced instructional capabilities. Despite incorporating vast image and language pre-training, these multi-modal architectures often generate responses that deviate from the ground truth in the image data. These failure cases are known as hallucinations. Current methods for mitigating hallucinations generally focus on regularizing the language component, improving the fusion module, or ensembling multiple visual encoders to improve visual representation. In this paper, we address the hallucination issue by directly enhancing the capabilities of the visual component. Our approach, named EAGLE, is fully agnostic to the LLM or fusion module and works as a post-pretraining approach that improves the grounding and language alignment of the visual encoder. We show that a straightforward reformulation of the original contrastive pre-training task results in an improved visual encoder that can be incorporated into the instructional multi-modal architecture without additional instructional training. As a result, EAGLE achieves a significant reduction in hallucinations across multiple challenging benchmarks and tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02699v1,"cs.CV, cs.AI"

These models now exhibit remarkable performance across various language-related tasks, such as text generation, question answering, translation, and summarization, often rivaling human-like comprehension. More intriguingly, LLMs have demonstrated emergent abilities extending beyond their core functions, showing proficiency in tasks like commonsense reasoning, code generation, and arithmetic. This survey paper explores the foundational components, scaling mechanisms, and architectural strategies that drive these capabilities. Emphasizing models like GPT and LLaMA, we analyze the impact of exponential data and computational growth on LLM performance, while also addressing the trade-offs associated with scaling.

SDPO: Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization for Social Agents,"Aobo Kong, Wentao Ma, Shiwan Zhao, Yongbin Li, Yuchuan Wu, Ke Wang, Xiaoqian Liu, Qicheng Li, Yong Qin, Fei Huang",2025-01-03,"Social agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can simulate human social behaviors but fall short in handling complex social dialogues. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across various agent tasks. However, standard DPO focuses solely on individual turns, which limits its effectiveness in multi-turn social interactions. Several DPO-based multi-turn alignment methods with session-level data have shown potential in addressing this problem.While these methods consider multiple turns across entire sessions, they are often overly coarse-grained, introducing training noise, and lack robust theoretical support. To resolve these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which dynamically select key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior. SDPO minimizes training noise and is grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents.

Safeguarding Large Language Models in Real-time with Tunable Safety-Performance Trade-offs,"Joao Fonseca, Andrew Bell, Julia Stoyanovich",2025-01-02,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks, or adversarial attacks used to illicit high risk behavior from a model. Jailbreaks have been exploited by cybercriminals and blackhat actors to cause significant harm, highlighting the critical need to safeguard widely-deployed models. Safeguarding approaches, which include fine-tuning models or having LLMs ""self-reflect"", may lengthen the inference time of a model, incur a computational penalty, reduce the semantic fluency of an output, and restrict ``normal'' model behavior. Importantly, these Safety-Performance Trade-offs (SPTs) remain an understudied area. In this work, we introduce a novel safeguard, called SafeNudge, that combines Controlled Text Generation with ""nudging"", or using text interventions to change the behavior of a model. SafeNudge triggers during text-generation while a jailbreak attack is being executed, and can reduce successful jailbreak attempts by 30% by guiding the LLM towards a safe responses.

However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions.
