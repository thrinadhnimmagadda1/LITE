ELECTRA and GPT-4o: Cost-Effective Partners for Sentiment Analysis,James P. Beno,2024-12-29,"Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.50 macro F1 vs. 79.14 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.41 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.70) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00062v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7"
"A Paragraph is All It Takes: Rich Robot Behaviors from Interacting, Trusted LLMs","OpenMind, Shaohong Zhong, Adam Zhou, Boyuan Chen, Homin Luo, Jan Liphardt",2024-12-24,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18588v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.SY, eess.SY"

Research on the Proximity Relationships of Psychosomatic Disease Knowledge Graph Modules Extracted by Large Language Models,"Zihan Zhou, Ziyi Zeng, Wenhao Jiang, Yihui Zhu, Jiaxin Mao, Yonggui Yuan, Min Xia, Shubin Zhao, Mengyu Yao, Yunqian Chen",2024-12-24,"As social changes accelerate, the incidence of psychosomatic disorders has significantly increased, becoming a major challenge in global health issues. This necessitates an innovative knowledge system and analytical methods to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we establish the ontology model and entity types, using the BERT model and LoRA-tuned LLM for named entity recognition, constructing the knowledge graph with 9668 triples. Next, by analyzing the network distances between disease, symptom, and drug modules, it was found that closer network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in their clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological mechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more likely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score, it was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships have a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in diagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential connections between diseases, co-occurring symptoms, and similarities in treatment strategies, providing new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of psychosomatic disorders and valuable information for future mental health research and practice.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18419v1,cs.AI
VISION: A Modular AI Assistant for Natural Human-Instrument Interaction at Scientific User Facilities,"Shray Mathur, Noah van der Vleuten, Kevin Yager, Esther Tsai",2024-12-24,"Scientific user facilities, such as synchrotron beamlines, are equipped with a wide array of hardware and software tools that require a codebase for human-computer-interaction. This often necessitates developers to be involved to establish connection between users/researchers and the complex instrumentation. The advent of generative AI presents an opportunity to bridge this knowledge gap, enabling seamless communication and efficient experimental workflows. Here we present a modular architecture for the Virtual Scientific Companion (VISION) by assembling multiple AI-enabled cognitive blocks that each scaffolds large language models (LLMs) for a specialized task. With VISION, we performed LLM-based operation on the beamline workstation with low latency and demonstrated the first voice-controlled experiment at an X-ray scattering beamline. The modular and scalable architecture allows for easy adaptation to new instrument and capabilities. Development on natural language-based scientific experimentation is a building block for an impending future where a science exocortex -- a synthetic extension to the cognition of scientists -- may radically transform scientific practice and discovery.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18161v1,cs.AI
Multi-Modal Grounded Planning and Efficient Replanning For Learning Embodied Agents with A Few Examples,"Taewoong Kim, Byeonghwi Kim, Jonghyun Choi",2024-12-23,"Learning a perception and reasoning module for robotic assistants to plan steps to perform complex tasks based on natural language instructions often requires large free-form language annotations, especially for short high-level instructions. To reduce the cost of annotation, large language models (LLMs) are used as a planner with few data. However, when elaborating the steps, even the state-of-the-art planner that uses LLMs mostly relies on linguistic common sense, often neglecting the status of the environment at command reception, resulting in inappropriate plans. To generate plans grounded in the environment, we propose FLARE (Few-shot Language with environmental Adaptive Replanning Embodied agent), which improves task planning using both language command and environmental perception. As language instructions often contain ambiguities or incorrect expressions, we additionally propose to correct the mistakes using visual cues from the agent. The proposed scheme allows us to use a few language pairs thanks to the visual cues and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Visual Prompting with Iterative Refinement for Design Critique Generation,"Peitong Duan, Chin-Yi Cheng, Bjoern Hartmann, Yang Li",2024-12-22,"Feedback is crucial for every design process, such as user interface (UI) design, and automating design critiques can significantly improve the efficiency of the design workflow. Although existing multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, they often struggle with generating high-quality design critiques -- a complex task that requires producing detailed design comments that are visually grounded in a given design's image. Building on recent advancements in iterative refinement of text output and visual prompting methods, we propose an iterative visual prompting approach for UI critique that takes an input UI screenshot and design guidelines and generates a list of design comments, along with corresponding bounding boxes that map each comment to a specific region in the screenshot. The entire process is driven completely by LLMs, which iteratively refine both the text output and bounding boxes using few-shot samples tailored for each step. We evaluated our approach using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, and found that human experts generally preferred the design critiques generated by our pipeline over those by the baseline, with the pipeline reducing the gap from human performance by 50% for one rating metric. To assess the generalizability of our approach to other multimodal tasks, we applied our pipeline to open-vocabulary object and attribute detection, and experiments showed that our method also outperformed the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16829v2,cs.AI
Argumentation Computation with Large Language Models : A Benchmark Study,"Zhaoqun Li, Xiaotong Fang, Chen Chen, Mengze Li, Beishui Liao",2024-12-21,"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in neuro-symbolic computing. However, the combination of LLM with argumentation computation remains an underexplored domain, despite its considerable potential for real-world applications requiring defeasible reasoning. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of LLMs in determining the extensions of various abstract argumentation semantics. To achieve this, we develop and curate a benchmark comprising diverse abstract argumentation frameworks, accompanied by detailed explanations of algorithms for computing extensions. Subsequently, we fine-tune LLMs on the proposed benchmark, focusing on two fundamental extension-solving tasks. As a comparative baseline, LLMs are evaluated using a chain-of-thought approach, where they struggle to accurately compute semantics. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the process explanation plays a crucial role in semantics computation learning. Models trained with explanations show superior generalization accuracy compared to those trained solely with question-answer pairs. Furthermore, by leveraging the self-explanation capabilities of LLMs, our approach provides detailed illustrations that mitigate the lack of transparency typically associated with neural networks. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of LLMs' potential in argumentation computation, offering promising avenues for further research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16725v1,cs.AI
Internalized Self-Correction for Large Language Models,"Nishanth Upadhyaya, Raghavendra Sridharamurthy",2024-12-21,"In this article, we introduce 'Internalized Self-Correction' (InSeC) for large language models (LLMs). While many approaches exist for self-reflection at inference time, we propose a novel method that combines ideas from negative sampling, self-reflection during training, and inference time. InSeC allows LLMs to correct themselves by introducing mistakes and their corresponding corrections during training, thereby converting the learning process into a true supervised learning task with both positive and negative examples. This approach can be extended to improve instruction following and correct hallucinations or incorrect sentences generated by LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16653v1,cs.AI
Mathematics and Machine Creativity: A Survey on Bridging Mathematics with AI,"Shizhe Liang, Wei Zhang, Tianyang Zhong, Tianming Liu",2024-12-21,"This paper presents a comprehensive overview on the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in mathematical research, highlighting the transformative role AI has begun to play in this domain. Traditionally, AI advancements have heavily relied on theoretical foundations provided by mathematics and statistics. However, recent developments in AI, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential for AI to contribute back to mathematics by offering flexible algorithmic frameworks and powerful inductive reasoning capabilities that support various aspects of mathematical research. This survey aims to establish a bridge between AI and mathematics, providing insights into the mutual benefits and fostering deeper interdisciplinary understanding. In particular, we argue that while current AI and LLMs may struggle with complex deductive reasoning, their ""inherent creativity"", the ability to generate outputs at high throughput based on recognition of shallow patterns, holds significant potential to support and inspire mathematical research. This creative capability, often overlooked, could be the key to unlocking new perspectives and methodologies in mathematics. Furthermore, we address the lack of cross-disciplinary communication: mathematicians may not fully comprehend the latest advances in AI, while AI researchers frequently prioritize benchmark performance over real-world applications in frontier mathematical research. This paper seeks to close that gap, offering a detailed exploration of AI fundamentals, its strengths, and its emerging applications in the mathematical sciences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16543v3,cs.AI

Analysis and Visualization of Linguistic Structures in Large Language Models: Neural Representations of Verb-Particle Constructions in BERT,"Hassane Kissane, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss",2024-12-19,"This study investigates the internal representations of verb-particle combinations within transformer-based large language models (LLMs), specifically examining how these models capture lexical and syntactic nuances at different neural network layers. Employing the BERT architecture, we analyse the representational efficacy of its layers for various verb-particle constructions such as 'agree on', 'come back', and 'give up'. Our methodology includes a detailed dataset preparation from the British National Corpus, followed by extensive model training and output analysis through techniques like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and generalized discrimination value (GDV) calculations. Results show that BERT's middle layers most effectively capture syntactic structures, with significant variability in representational accuracy across different verb categories. These findings challenge the conventional uniformity assumed in neural network processing of linguistic elements and suggest a complex interplay between network architecture and linguistic representation. Our research contributes to a better understanding of how deep learning models comprehend and process language, offering insights into the potential and limitations of current neural approaches to linguistic analysis.

Tree-of-Code: A Hybrid Approach for Robust Complex Task Planning and Execution,"Ziyi Ni, Yifan Li, Daxiang Dong",2024-12-18,"The exceptional capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have substantially accelerated the rapid rise and widespread adoption of agents.

AI Predicts AGI: Leveraging AGI Forecasting and Peer Review to Explore LLMs' Complex Reasoning Capabilities,"Fabrizio Davide, Pietro Torre, Leonardo Ercolani, Andrea Gaggioli",2024-12-12,"We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030. To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts. This analysis led to the development of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in AGI-related tasks. Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex, uncertain real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09385v2,"cs.AI, I.2.7"
Generative Agents for Multi-Agent Autoformalization of Interaction Scenarios,"Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis, Vince Trencsenyi",2024-12-11,"Multi-agent simulations are versatile tools for exploring interactions among natural and artificial agents, but their development typically demands domain expertise and manual effort. This work introduces the Generative Agents for Multi-Agent Autoformalization (GAMA) framework, which automates the formalization of interaction scenarios in simulations using agents augmented with large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate the application of GAMA, we use natural language descriptions of game-theoretic scenarios representing social interactions, and we autoformalize them into executable logic programs defining game rules, with syntactic correctness enforced through a solver-based validation. To ensure runtime validity, an iterative, tournament-based procedure tests the generated rules and strategies, followed by exact semantic validation when ground truth outcomes are available. In experiments with 110 natural language descriptions across five 2x2 simultaneous-move games, GAMA achieves 100% syntactic and 76.5% semantic correctness with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and 99.82% syntactic and 77% semantic correctness with GPT-4o.

Mining Math Conjectures from LLMs: A Pruning Approach,"Jake Chuharski, Elias Rojas Collins, Mark Meringolo",2024-12-09,"We present a novel approach to generating mathematical conjectures using Large Language Models (LLMs). Focusing on the solubilizer, a relatively recent construct in group theory, we demonstrate how LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can be leveraged to generate conjectures. These conjectures are pruned by allowing the LLMs to generate counterexamples. Our results indicate that LLMs are capable of producing original conjectures that, while not groundbreaking, are either plausible or falsifiable via counterexamples, though they exhibit limitations in code execution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16177v1,cs.AI
The Rosetta Paradox: Domain-Specific Performance Inversions in Large Language Models,"Basab Jha, Ujjwal Puri",2024-12-09,"While large language models, such as GPT and BERT, have already demonstrated unprecedented skills in everything from natural language processing to domain-specific applications, there came an unexplored phenomenon we term the Rosetta Paradox. The Rosetta Paradox characterizes the counterintuitive performance inversions across domains of knowledge. This paradox captures how such LLMs can excel in highly specialized fields but do poorly on tasks which require general, everyday knowledge. This paper formalizes the definition of the Rosetta Paradox and introduces a panoramic analysis framework that includes both a Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and a Performance Inversion Metric (PIM) for consistent quantification of domain-specific behavior in LLMs. We adopt this paradox and conduct a series of investigations through extensive experiments across diverse models and knowledge domains, ranging from rich technical areas to common-sense reasoning. Our findings indicate that the Rosetta Paradox is likely not a mere artifact of data distribution but an intrinsic architectural and emergent property of deep neural networks. We present comparative analyses across different model architectures, sizes, and training methodologies that shed light into the peculiar ways this paradox manifests itself and challenge the standard evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17821v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Query-Efficient Planning with Language Models,"Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Wayne Chen, Kushal Kedia, Sanjiban Choudhury",2024-12-09,"Planning in complex environments requires an agent to efficiently query a world model to find a feasible sequence of actions from start to goal. Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by searching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In this paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that leverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic within a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose promising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an entire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt based on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable baselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer interactions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly adapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a heuristic.

Are Frontier Large Language Models Suitable for Q&A in Science Centres?,"Jacob Watson, Fabrício Góes, Marco Volpe, Talles Medeiros",2024-12-06,"This paper investigates the suitability of frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) for Q&A interactions in science centres, with the aim of boosting visitor engagement while maintaining factual accuracy. Using a dataset of questions collected from the National Space Centre in Leicester (UK), we evaluated responses generated by three leading models: OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini 1.5. Each model was prompted for both standard and creative responses tailored to an 8-year-old audience, and these responses were assessed by space science experts based on accuracy, engagement, clarity, novelty, and deviation from expected answers. The results revealed a trade-off between creativity and accuracy, with Claude outperforming GPT and Gemini in both maintaining clarity and engaging young audiences, even when asked to generate more creative responses. Nonetheless, experts observed that higher novelty was generally associated with reduced factual reliability across all models.

These challenges often lead to inefficiencies in memory utilization, latency, and throughput, hindering the effective deployment of LLMs, especially for non-experts. Through extensive experiments, we identify key performance bottlenecks, including sudden drops in memory utilization, latency fluctuations with varying batch sizes, and inefficiencies in multi-GPU configurations. These insights reveal a vast optimization space shaped by the intricate interplay of hardware, frameworks, and workload parameters. This underscores the need for a systematic approach to optimize LLM inference, motivating the design of our framework, GUIDE. GUIDE leverages dynamic modeling and simulation-based optimization to address these issues, achieving prediction errors between 9.9% and 42.3% for key metrics such as batch latency, TTFT, and decode throughput.

Targeting the Core: A Simple and Effective Method to Attack RAG-based Agents via Direct LLM Manipulation,"Xuying Li, Zhuo Li, Yuji Kosuga, Yasuhiro Yoshida, Victor Bian",2024-12-05,"AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), have transformed human-computer interactions by enabling seamless, natural, and context-aware communication. While these advancements offer immense utility, they also inherit and amplify inherent safety risks such as bias, fairness, hallucinations, privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. This paper investigates a critical vulnerability: adversarial attacks targeting the LLM core within AI agents. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that a deceptively simple adversarial prefix, such as \textit{Ignore the document}, can compel LLMs to produce dangerous or unintended outputs by bypassing their contextual safeguards. Through experimentation, we demonstrate a high attack success rate (ASR), revealing the fragility of existing LLM defenses.

Methods: Unlike previous attempts that might use basic methods like ChatGPT, our approach involves more targeted strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce contextually relevant and pedagogically meaningful learning objects. Results and Conclusions: Our results show that generating structural, semantic annotations works well. However, this success was not reflected in the case of relational annotations.

Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers,"Jungwoo Park, Young Jin Ahn, Kee-Eung Kim, Jaewoo Kang",2024-12-05,"Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior.

In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize usable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two programming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing algorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled by LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including five miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an environment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the framework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29 tasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLMs depends more on the task than on model size. While larger models generate more executable programs, these do not always result in higher-quality solutions but are much more expensive. No model has a clear advantage, although on any specific task, one model may be better. Trying many models on a problem and using the best results across them is more reliable than using just one.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04057v1,cs.AI
Agent AI with LangGraph: A Modular Framework for Enhancing Machine Translation Using Large Language Models,"Jialin Wang, Zhihua Duan",2024-12-05,"This paper explores the transformative role of Agent AI and LangGraph in advancing the automation and effectiveness of machine translation (MT). Agents are modular components designed to perform specific tasks, such as translating between particular languages, with specializations like TranslateEnAgent, TranslateFrenchAgent, and TranslateJpAgent for English, French, and Japanese translations, respectively.

Automated Multi-Label Annotation for Mental Health Illnesses Using Large Language Models,"Abdelrahaman A. Hassan, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda",2024-12-05,"The growing prevalence and complexity of mental health disorders present significant challenges for accurate diagnosis and treatment, particularly in understanding the interplay between co-occurring conditions. Mental health disorders, such as depression and Anxiety, often co-occur, yet current datasets derived from social media posts typically focus on single-disorder labels, limiting their utility in comprehensive diagnostic analyses. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel methodology for cleaning, sampling, labeling, and combining data to create versatile multi-label datasets. Our approach introduces a synthetic labeling technique to transform single-label datasets into multi-label annotations, capturing the complexity of overlapping mental health conditions. To achieve this, two single-label datasets are first merged into a foundational multi-label dataset, enabling realistic analyses of co-occurring diagnoses. We then design and evaluate various prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs), ranging from single-label predictions to unrestricted prompts capable of detecting any present disorders. After rigorously assessing multiple LLMs and prompt configurations, the optimal combinations are identified and applied to label six additional single-disorder datasets from RMHD. The result is SPAADE-DR, a robust, multi-label dataset encompassing diverse mental health conditions. This research demonstrates the transformative potential of LLM-driven synthetic labeling in advancing mental health diagnostics from social media data, paving the way for more nuanced, data-driven insights into mental health care.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03796v1,cs.AI

You're (Not) My Type -- Can LLMs Generate Feedback of Specific Types for Introductory Programming Tasks?,"Dominic Lohr, Hieke Keuning, Natalie Kiesler",2024-12-04,"Background: Feedback as one of the most influential factors for learning has been subject to a great body of research. It plays a key role in the development of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in deterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience. However, with the rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we expect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the context of programming. In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback for learners of programming. LLMs may create new possibilities to provide richer, and more individual feedback than ever before. Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for introductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback taxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as randomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation. Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific feedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to authentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and determined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types. Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of different feedback dimensions and characteristics.

Large Language Models show both individual and collective creativity comparable to humans,"Luning Sun, Yuzhuo Yuan, Yuan Yao, Yanyan Li, Hao Zhang, Xing Xie, Xiting Wang, Fang Luo, David Stillwell",2024-12-04,"Artificial intelligence has, so far, largely automated routine tasks, but what does it mean for the future of work if Large Language Models (LLMs) show creativity comparable to humans? To measure the creativity of LLMs holistically, the current study uses 13 creative tasks spanning three domains. We benchmark the LLMs against individual humans, and also take a novel approach by comparing them to the collective creativity of groups of humans. We find that the best LLMs (Claude and GPT-4) rank in the 52nd percentile against humans, and overall LLMs excel in divergent thinking and problem solving but lag in creative writing. When questioned 10 times, an LLM's collective creativity is equivalent to 8-10 humans. When more responses are requested, two additional responses of LLMs equal one extra human.

CredID: Credible Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models Identification,"Haoyu Jiang, Xuhong Wang, Ping Yi, Shanzhe Lei, Yilun Lin",2024-12-04,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in complex natural language processing tasks but raise privacy and security concerns due to the lack of identity recognition. This paper proposes a multi-party credible watermarking framework (CredID) involving a trusted third party (TTP) and multiple LLM vendors to address these issues. In the watermark embedding stage, vendors request a seed from the TTP to generate watermarked text without sending the user's prompt. In the extraction stage, the TTP coordinates each vendor to extract and verify the watermark from the text. This provides a credible watermarking scheme while preserving vendor privacy. Furthermore, current watermarking algorithms struggle with text quality, information capacity, and robustness, making it challenging to meet the diverse identification needs of LLMs. Thus, we propose a novel multi-bit watermarking algorithm and an open-source toolkit to facilitate research. Experiments show our CredID enhances watermark credibility and efficiency without compromising text quality. Additionally, we successfully utilized this framework to achieve highly accurate identification among multiple LLM vendors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03107v1,cs.AI
ChatTS: Aligning Time Series with LLMs via Synthetic Data for Enhanced Understanding and Reasoning,"Zhe Xie, Zeyan Li, Xiao He, Longlong Xu, Xidao Wen, Tieying Zhang, Jianjun Chen, Rui Shi, Dan Pei",2024-12-04,"Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks.

Flattering to Deceive: The Impact of Sycophantic Behavior on User Trust in Large Language Model,María Victoria Carro,2024-12-03,"Sycophancy refers to the tendency of a large language model to align its outputs with the user's perceived preferences, beliefs, or opinions, in order to look favorable, regardless of whether those statements are factually correct. This behavior can lead to undesirable consequences, such as reinforcing discriminatory biases or amplifying misinformation. Given that sycophancy is often linked to human feedback training mechanisms, this study explores whether sycophantic tendencies negatively impact user trust in large language models or, conversely, whether users consider such behavior as favorable. To investigate this, we instructed one group of participants to answer ground-truth questions with the assistance of a GPT specifically designed to provide sycophantic responses, while another group used the standard version of ChatGPT. Initially, participants were required to use the language model, after which they were given the option to continue using it if they found it trustworthy and useful. Trust was measured through both demonstrated actions and self-reported perceptions. The findings consistently show that participants exposed to sycophantic behavior reported and exhibited lower levels of trust compared to those who interacted with the standard version of the model, despite the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the model's output.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02802v1,cs.AI

Our work evaluates the capabilities of LLMs in ontology learning in the context of highly specialized and complex domains such as life science domains. To assess the logical consistency, completeness, and scalability of the generated ontologies, we use the AquaDiva ontology developed and used in the collaborative research center AquaDiva as a case study.

Improving Physics Reasoning in Large Language Models Using Mixture of Refinement Agents,"Raj Jaiswal, Dhruv Jain, Harsh Parimal Popat, Avinash Anand, Abhishek Dharmadhikari, Atharva Marathe, Rajiv Ratn Shah",2024-12-01,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks. However, they encounter significant challenges when it comes to scientific reasoning, particularly in physics, which requires not only mathematical reasoning but also factual and conceptual understanding. When addressing complex physics problems, LLMs typically face three key issues: problem miscomprehension, incorrect concept application, and computational errors. While each of these problems can be addressed individually, there is a need for a generalized approach that can tackle all three issues simultaneously. To address this, we introduce Mixture of Refinement Agents (MoRA), a novel agentic refinement framework that iteratively refines the LLM generated base solution by correcting the aforementioned errors, resulting in a significant performance improvement for open-source LLMs. Our approach aims to bridge the gap between opensource LLMs and GPT-4o by utilizing the latter as error identifier to guide these refinement agents. We evaluate our approach on the SciEval and MMLU subsets along with our own physics dataset (PhysicsQA).

Turing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): A Flexible Method for Measuring Alignment Between Human and Artificial Intelligence,"Mattson Ogg, Ritwik Bose, Jamie Scharf, Christopher Ratto, Michael Wolmetz",2024-11-30,"As we consider entrusting Large Language Models (LLMs) with key societal and decision-making roles, measuring their alignment with human cognition becomes critical. This requires methods that can assess how these systems represent information and facilitate comparisons to human understanding across diverse tasks. To meet this need, we developed Turing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), a method that uses pairwise similarity ratings to quantify alignment between AIs and humans. We tested this approach on semantic alignment across text and image modalities, measuring how different Large Language and Vision Language Model (LLM and VLM) similarity judgments aligned with human responses at both group and individual levels. GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with human performance among the models we tested, particularly when leveraging its text processing capabilities rather than image processing, regardless of the input modality. However, no model we studied adequately captured the inter-individual variability observed among human participants. This method helped uncover certain hyperparameters and prompts that could steer model behavior to have more or less human-like qualities at an inter-individual or group level. Turing RSA enables the efficient and flexible quantification of human-AI alignment and complements existing accuracy-based benchmark tasks. We demonstrate its utility across multiple modalities (words, sentences, images) for understanding how LLMs encode knowledge and for examining representational alignment with human cognition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00577v2,cs.AI

Our approach generates executable Workflows from Intention, defined as the alignment of Client Input, Client Output, and Process Context. These Workflows are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with nodes as Tasks consisting of sequences of executable Instructions, including tools and human expert reviews. We adopt a two-phase methodology: Workflow Generation and Workflow Optimization. In the Generation phase, Workflows are generated using a Large Work Model (LWM) informed by a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) that encodes domain-specific procedural and operational knowledge. In the Optimization phase, Workflows are transformed into Workflow Graphs (WFGs), where optimal Workflows are determined through path optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in reliably retrieving detailed process data as well as generating industry-compliant workflows. The key contributions of this paper include integrating a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) into a Large Work Model (LWM) to enable the generation of context-aware, semantically aligned, structured and auditable Workflows.

Our methodology involves a novel pipeline that corrects ASR-generated captions using advanced LLMs. It explicitly focuses on models like GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13B due to their robust performance in language comprehension and generation tasks. We introduce a dataset representative of real-world challenges the DHH community faces to evaluate our proposed pipeline. Our results indicate that LLM-enhanced captions significantly improve accuracy, as evidenced by a notably lower Word Error Rate (WER) achieved by ChatGPT-3.5 (WER: 9.75%) compared to the original ASR captions (WER: 23.07%), ChatGPT-3.5 shows an approximate 57.72% improvement in WER compared to the original ASR captions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00342v2,cs.AI
PDDLFuse: A Tool for Generating Diverse Planning Domains,"Vedant Khandelwal, Amit Sheth, Forest Agostinelli",2024-11-29,"Various real-world challenges require planning algorithms that can adapt to a broad range of domains. Traditionally, the creation of planning domains has relied heavily on human implementation, which limits the scale and diversity of available domains.

The ever-increasing number of research articles provides a huge challenge for manual literature review. It has resulted in an increased demand for automation. Developing a system capable of automatically generating the literature reviews from only the PDF files as input is the primary objective of this research work. The effectiveness of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies, such as the frequency-based method (spaCy), the transformer model (Simple T5), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language Model (GPT-3.5-turbo), is evaluated to meet the primary objective. The SciTLDR dataset is chosen for this research experiment and three distinct techniques are utilized to implement three different systems for auto-generating the literature reviews. The ROUGE scores are used for the evaluation of all three systems. Based on the evaluation, the Large Language Model GPT-3.5-turbo achieved the highest ROUGE-1 score, 0.364.

LLMs also serve as the world model for deliberative reasoning in Reasoning via Planning (RAP) and Tree of Thought (ToT). However, the world models are either evaluated as a general world simulator, or as a functional module of the agent, i.e., predicting the transitions to assist the planning. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of the world models with LLMs from the decision making perspective. Specifically, we leverage the 31 diverse environments from (Wang et al., 2023;2024) and curate the rule-based policy of each environment for the diverse evaluation.

Responsible AI in Construction Safety: Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models and Prompt Engineering,"Farouq Sammour, Jia Xu, Xi Wang, Mo Hu, Zhenyu Zhang",2024-11-13,"Construction remains one of the most hazardous sectors. Recent advancements in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising opportunities for enhancing workplace safety. However, responsible integration of LLMs requires systematic evaluation, as deploying them without understanding their capabilities and limitations risks generating inaccurate information, fostering misplaced confidence, and compromising worker safety. This study evaluates the performance of two widely used LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, across three standardized exams administered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (BCSP). Using 385 questions spanning seven safety knowledge areas, the study analyzes the models' accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Results show that both models consistently exceed the BCSP benchmark, with GPT-4o achieving an accuracy rate of 84.6% and GPT-3.5 reaching 73.8%. Both models demonstrate strengths in safety management systems and hazard identification and control, but exhibit weaknesses in science, mathematics, emergency response, and fire prevention. An error analysis identifies four primary limitations affecting LLM performance: lack of knowledge, reasoning flaws, memory issues, and calculation errors. Our study also highlights the impact of prompt engineering strategies, with variations in accuracy reaching 13.5% for GPT-3.5 and 7.9% for GPT-4o. However, no single prompt configuration proves universally effective. This research advances knowledge in three ways: by identifying areas where LLMs can support safety practices and where human oversight remains essential, by offering practical insights into improving LLM implementation through prompt engineering, and by providing evidence-based direction for future research and development.

"Rethinking Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-Based Reward Modeling: Foundations, Theory, and Alternatives","Hao Sun, Yunyi Shen, Jean-Francois Ton",2024-11-07,"The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward.

Plan-on-Graph: Self-Correcting Adaptive Planning of Large Language Model on Knowledge Graphs,"Liyi Chen, Panrong Tong, Zhongming Jin, Ying Sun, Jieping Ye, Hui Xiong",2024-10-31,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex tasks, but they still suffer from out-of-date knowledge, hallucinations, and opaque decision-making. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide explicit and editable knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. Existing paradigm of KG-augmented LLM manually predefines the breadth of exploration space and requires flawless navigation in KGs. However, this paradigm cannot adaptively explore reasoning paths in KGs based on the question semantics and self-correct erroneous reasoning paths, resulting in a bottleneck in efficiency and effect. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-augmented LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG), which first decomposes the question into several sub-objectives and then repeats the process of adaptively exploring reasoning paths, updating memory, and reflecting on the need to self-correct erroneous reasoning paths until arriving at the answer. Specifically, three important mechanisms of Guidance, Memory, and Reflection are designed to work together, to guarantee the adaptive breadth of self-correcting planning for graph reasoning.

Enabling Energy-Efficient Deployment of Large Language Models on Memristor Crossbar: A Synergy of Large and Small,"Zhehui Wang, Tao Luo, Cheng Liu, Weichen Liu, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Weng-Fai Wong",2024-10-21,"Large language models (LLMs) have garnered substantial attention due to their promising applications in diverse domains. Nevertheless, the increasing size of LLMs comes with a significant surge in the computational requirements for training and deployment. Memristor crossbars have emerged as a promising solution, which demonstrated a small footprint and remarkably high energy efficiency in computer vision (CV) models. Memristors possess higher density compared to conventional memory technologies, making them highly suitable for effectively managing the extreme model size associated with LLMs. However, deploying LLMs on memristor crossbars faces three major challenges. Firstly, the size of LLMs increases rapidly, already surpassing the capabilities of state-of-the-art memristor chips. Secondly, LLMs often incorporate multi-head attention blocks, which involve non-weight stationary multiplications that traditional memristor crossbars cannot support. Third, while memristor crossbars excel at performing linear operations, they are not capable of executing complex nonlinear operations in LLM such as softmax and layer normalization. To address these challenges, we present a novel architecture for the memristor crossbar that enables the deployment of state-of-the-art LLM on a single chip or package, eliminating the energy and time inefficiencies associated with off-chip communication. Our testing on BERT_Large showed negligible accuracy loss. Compared to traditional memristor crossbars, our architecture achieves enhancements of up to 39X in area overhead and 18X in energy consumption.

To address this issue, we propose a flexible framework that enables LLMs to interact with system interfaces, summarize constraint concepts, and continually optimize performance metrics by collaborating with human experts. As a case in point, we initialized a travel planner agent by establishing constraints from evaluation interfaces. Then, we employed both LLM-based and human discriminators to identify critical cases and continuously improve agent performance until the desired outcomes were achieved.

A Prompt Refinement-based Large Language Model for Metro Passenger Flow Forecasting under Delay Conditions,"Ping Huang, Yuxin He, Hao Wang, Jingjing Chen, Qin Luo",2024-10-19,"Accurate short-term forecasts of passenger flow in metro systems under delay conditions are crucial for emergency response and service recovery, which pose significant challenges and are currently under-researched. Due to the rare occurrence of delay events, the limited sample size under delay condictions make it difficult for conventional models to effectively capture the complex impacts of delays on passenger flow, resulting in low forecasting accuracy. Recognizing the strengths of large language models (LLMs) in few-shot learning due to their powerful pre-training, contextual understanding, ability to perform zero-shot and few-shot reasoning, to address the issues that effectively generalize and adapt with minimal data, we propose a passenger flow forecasting framework under delay conditions that synthesizes an LLM with carefully designed prompt engineering. By Refining prompt design, we enable the LLM to understand delay event information and the pattern from historical passenger flow data, thus overcoming the challenges of passenger flow forecasting under delay conditions. The propmpt engineering in the framework consists of two main stages: systematic prompt generation and prompt refinement. In the prompt generation stage, multi-source data is transformed into descriptive texts understandable by the LLM and stored. In the prompt refinement stage, we employ the multidimensional Chain of Thought (CoT) method to refine the prompts.

NT-LLM: A Novel Node Tokenizer for Integrating Graph Structure into Large Language Models,"Yanbiao Ji, Chang Liu, Xin Chen, Yue Ding, Dan Luo, Mei Li, Wenqing Lin, Hongtao Lu",2024-10-14,"Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relationships in real-world scenarios. With the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been growing interest in integrating LLMs for graph learning. However, applying LLMs to graph-related tasks poses significant challenges, as these models are not inherently designed to capture the complex structural information present in graphs. Existing approaches address this challenge through two strategies: the chain of tasks approach, which uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the graph structure so that LLMs are relieved from understanding spatial positions; and Graph-to-Text Conversion, which translates graph structures into semantic text representations that LLMs can process. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle to fully preserve the topological information of graphs or require extensive computational resources, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we introduce Node Tokenizer for Large Language Models (NT-LLM), a novel framework that efficiently encodes graph structures by selecting key nodes as anchors and representing each node based on its relative distance to these anchors. This position-anchored encoding effectively captures the graph topology, enabling enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs over graph data. Additionally, we implement a task-specific tuning procedure to further improve structural understanding within LLMs. Through extensive empirical evaluations, NT-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements across a variety of graph-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10743v1,cs.AI
"Innovative Thinking, Infinite Humor: Humor Research of Large Language Models through Structured Thought Leaps","Han Wang, Yilin Zhao, Dian Li, Xiaohan Wang, Gang Liu, Xuguang Lan, Hui Wang",2024-10-14,"Humor is previously regarded as a gift exclusive to humans for the following reasons. Humor is a culturally nuanced aspect of human language, presenting challenges for its understanding and generation. Humor generation necessitates a multi-hop reasoning process, with each hop founded on proper rationales. Although many studies, such as those related to GPT-o1, focus on logical reasoning with reflection and correction, they still fall short in humor generation. Due to the sparsity of the knowledge graph in creative thinking, it is arduous to achieve multi-hop reasoning. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a more robust framework for addressing the humor reasoning task, named LoL. LoL aims to inject external information to mitigate the sparsity of the knowledge graph, thereby enabling multi-hop reasoning. In the first stage of LoL, we put forward an automatic instruction-evolution method to incorporate the deeper and broader thinking processes underlying humor. Judgment-oriented instructions are devised to enhance the model's judgment capability, dynamically supplementing and updating the sparse knowledge graph. Subsequently, through reinforcement learning, the reasoning logic for each online-generated response is extracted using GPT-4o. In this process, external knowledge is re-introduced to aid the model in logical reasoning and the learning of human preferences. Finally, experimental results indicate that the combination of these two processes can enhance both the model's judgment ability and its generative capacity. These findings deepen our comprehension of the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and offer approaches to boost LLMs' creative abilities for cross-domain innovative applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10370v2,cs.AI
Beyond Graphs: Can Large Language Models Comprehend Hypergraphs?,"Yifan Feng, Chengwu Yang, Xingliang Hou, Shaoyi Du, Shihui Ying, Zongze Wu, Yue Gao",2024-10-14,"Existing benchmarks like NLGraph and GraphQA evaluate LLMs on graphs by focusing mainly on pairwise relationships, overlooking the high-order correlations found in real-world data. Hypergraphs, which can model complex beyond-pairwise relationships, offer a more robust framework but are still underexplored in the context of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce LLM4Hypergraph, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 21,500 problems across eight low-order, five high-order, and two isomorphism tasks, utilizing both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs from citation networks and protein structures. We evaluate six prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrating our benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model strengths and weaknesses. Our specialized prompting framework incorporates seven hypergraph languages and introduces two novel techniques, Hyper-BAG and Hyper-COT, which enhance high-order reasoning and achieve an average 4% (up to 9%) performance improvement on structure classification tasks.

Humanity in AI: Detecting the Personality of Large Language Models,"Baohua Zhan, Yongyi Huang, Wenyao Cui, Huaping Zhang, Jianyun Shang",2024-10-11,"Questionnaires are a common method for detecting the personality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their reliability is often compromised by two main issues: hallucinations (where LLMs produce inaccurate or irrelevant responses) and the sensitivity of responses to the order of the presented options. To address these issues, we propose combining text mining with questionnaires method. Text mining can extract psychological features from the LLMs' responses without being affected by the order of options. Furthermore, because this method does not rely on specific answers, it reduces the influence of hallucinations. By normalizing the scores from both methods and calculating the root mean square error, our experiment results confirm the effectiveness of this approach. To further investigate the origins of personality traits in LLMs, we conduct experiments on both pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and GPT, as well as conversational models (ChatLLMs), such as ChatGPT. The results show that LLMs do contain certain personalities, for example, ChatGPT and ChatGLM exhibit the personality traits of 'Conscientiousness'. Additionally, we find that the personalities of LLMs are derived from their pre-trained data. The instruction data used to train ChatLLMs can enhance the generation of data containing personalities and expose their hidden personality. We compare the results with the human average personality score, and we find that the personality of FLAN-T5 in PLMs and ChatGPT in ChatLLMs is more similar to that of a human, with score differences of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08545v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

Executing Arithmetic: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as Turing Machines,"Junyu Lai, Jiahe Xu, Yao Yang, Yunpeng Huang, Chun Cao, Jingwei Xu",2024-10-10,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing and reasoning tasks. However, their performance in the foundational domain of arithmetic remains unsatisfactory. When dealing with arithmetic tasks, LLMs often memorize specific examples rather than learning the underlying computational logic, limiting their ability to generalize to new problems. In this paper, we propose a Composable Arithmetic Execution Framework (CAEF) that enables LLMs to learn to execute step-by-step computations by emulating Turing Machines, thereby gaining a genuine understanding of computational logic. Moreover, the proposed framework is highly scalable, allowing composing learned operators to significantly reduce the difficulty of learning complex operators. In our evaluation, CAEF achieves nearly 100% accuracy across seven common mathematical operations on the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, effectively supporting computations involving operands with up to 100 digits, a level where GPT-4o falls short noticeably in some settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07896v1,"cs.AI, I.2.7"

Image First or Text First? Optimising the Sequencing of Modalities in Large Language Model Prompting and Reasoning Tasks,"Grant Wardle, Teo Susnjak",2024-10-04,"This paper examines how the sequencing of images and text within multi-modal prompts influences the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). We performed empirical evaluations using three commercial LLMs. Our results demonstrate that the order in which modalities are presented can significantly affect performance, particularly in tasks of varying complexity. For simpler tasks involving a single image, modality sequencing had a clear impact on accuracy. However, in more complex tasks involving multiple images and intricate reasoning steps, the effect of sequencing diminished, likely due to the increased cognitive demands of the task. Our findings also highlight the importance of question/prompt structure. In nested and multi-step reasoning tasks, modality sequencing played a key role in shaping model performance. While LLMs excelled in the initial stages of reasoning, they struggled to re-incorporate earlier information, underscoring the challenges of multi-hop reasoning within transformer architectures. This suggests that aligning the sequence of modalities with the logical flow of reasoning steps is more critical than modality order alone. These insights offer valuable implications for improving multi-modal prompt design, with broader applications across fields such as education, medical imaging, and cross-modal learning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03062v1,cs.AI

Compared to traditional RRT methods, LASMP reduces the number of nodes needed by 55% and cuts random sample queries by 80%, while still generating safe, collision-free paths. Tested in both simulated and real-world environments, LASMP has shown better performance in handling complex indoor scenarios. The results highlight the potential of combining language processing with motion planning to make robot navigation more efficient.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00649v1,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG"
Classification of Radiological Text in Small and Imbalanced Datasets in a Non-English Language,"Vincent Beliveau, Helene Kaas, Martin Prener, Claes N. Ladefoged, Desmond Elliott, Gitte M. Knudsen, Lars H. Pinborg, Melanie Ganz",2024-09-30,"Natural language processing (NLP) in the medical domain can underperform in real-world applications involving small datasets in a non-English language with few labeled samples and imbalanced classes. There is yet no consensus on how to approach this problem. We evaluated a set of NLP models including BERT-like transformers, few-shot learning with sentence transformers (SetFit), and prompted large language models (LLM), using three datasets of radiology reports on magnetic resonance images of epilepsy patients in Danish, a low-resource language. Our results indicate that BERT-like models pretrained in the target domain of radiology reports currently offer the optimal performances for this scenario. Notably, the SetFit and LLM models underperformed compared to BERT-like models, with LLM performing the worst. Importantly, none of the models investigated was sufficiently accurate to allow for text classification without any supervision.

SELP: Generating Safe and Efficient Task Plans for Robot Agents with Large Language Models,"Yi Wu, Zikang Xiong, Yiran Hu, Shreyash S. Iyengar, Nan Jiang, Aniket Bera, Lin Tan, Suresh Jagannathan",2024-09-28,"Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) that enhance robot agents' understanding and execution of natural language (NL) commands, ensuring the agents adhere to user-specified constraints remains challenging, particularly for complex commands and long-horizon tasks. To address this challenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained decoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM planners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures consistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the majority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then uses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific fine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific task domains. Our approach, Safe Efficient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these insights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands with high confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and robot manipulation. For drone navigation tasks, SELP outperforms state-of-the-art planners by 10.8% in safety rate (i.e., finishing tasks conforming to NL commands) and by 19.8% in plan efficiency.

However, these advancements introduce significant security challenges, with increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) using federated learning and large language models (LLMs). The core of our IDS is based on BERT, a transformer model adapted to identify malicious network flows. We modified this transformer to optimize performance on edge devices with limited resources. Experiments were conducted in both centralized and federated learning contexts. In the centralized setup, the model achieved an inference accuracy of 97.79%. In a federated learning context, the model was trained across multiple devices using both IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and non-IID data, based on various scenarios, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations. We also leveraged linear quantization to compress the model for deployment on edge devices. This reduction resulted in a slight decrease of 0.02% in accuracy for a model size reduction of 28.74%. The results underscore the viability of LLMs for deployment in IoT ecosystems, highlighting their ability to operate on devices with constrained computational and storage resources.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19390v1,"cs.CR, cs.AI"

"Evaluating Gender, Racial, and Age Biases in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis of Occupational and Crime Scenarios","Vishal Mirza, Rahul Kulkarni, Aakanksha Jadhav",2024-09-22,"Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have been notable, yet widespread enterprise adoption remains limited due to various constraints. This paper examines bias in LLMs-a crucial issue affecting their usability, reliability, and fairness. Researchers are developing strategies to mitigate bias, including debiasing layers, specialized reference datasets like Winogender and Winobias, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). These techniques have been integrated into the latest LLMs. Our study evaluates gender bias in occupational scenarios and gender, age, and racial bias in crime scenarios across four leading LLMs released in 2024: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B, Claude 3 Opus, and GPT-4o. Findings reveal that LLMs often depict female characters more frequently than male ones in various occupations, showing a 37% deviation from US BLS data. In crime scenarios, deviations from US FBI data are 54% for gender, 28% for race, and 17% for age. We observe that efforts to reduce gender and racial bias often lead to outcomes that may over-index one sub-class, potentially exacerbating the issue. These results highlight the limitations of current bias mitigation techniques and underscore the need for more effective approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14583v3,cs.AI
Can Large Language Models Logically Predict Myocardial Infarction?

However, high-quality evidence is urgently needed on the potential and limitation of LLMs in providing accurate clinical decisions based on real-world medical data. Objective: To evaluate quantitatively whether universal state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT and GPT-4) can predict the incidence risk of myocardial infarction (MI) with logical inference, and to further make comparison between various models to assess the performance of LLMs comprehensively. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 482,310 participants recruited from 2006 to 2010 were initially included in UK Biobank database and later on resampled into a final cohort of 690 participants. For each participant, tabular data of the risk factors of MI were transformed into standardized textual descriptions for ChatGPT recognition. Responses were generated by asking ChatGPT to select a score ranging from 0 to 10 representing the risk. Chain of Thought (CoT) questioning was used to evaluate whether LLMs make prediction logically. The predictive performance of ChatGPT was compared with published medical indices, traditional machine learning models and other large language models. Conclusions: Current LLMs are not ready to be applied in clinical medicine fields. Future medical LLMs are suggested to be expert in medical domain knowledge to understand both natural languages and quantified medical data, and further make logical inferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14478v1,cs.AI

We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and five state-of-the-art LLMs and show that one-shot LLM prompting indeed provides performances close to supervised models, with GPT 4-Turbo being the best model, followed by Claude 3 Opus. We conduct a quantitative analysis of the LLM explanations and show that most of the explanations provided by LLMs align with the post-hoc explanations of the supervised classifiers, and the explanations have high readability, coherency, and informativeness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14306v1,cs.AI

Enhancing Decision-Making for LLM Agents via Step-Level Q-Value Models,"Yuanzhao Zhai, Tingkai Yang, Kele Xu, Feng Dawei, Cheng Yang, Bo Ding, Huaimin Wang",2024-09-14,"Agents significantly enhance the capabilities of standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) by perceiving environments, making decisions, and executing actions. However, LLM agents still face challenges in tasks that require multiple decision-making steps. Estimating the value of actions in specific tasks is difficult when intermediate actions are neither appropriately rewarded nor penalized. In this paper, we propose leveraging a task-relevant Q-value model to guide action selection. Specifically, we first collect decision-making trajectories annotated with step-level Q values via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and construct preference data. We then use another LLM to fit these preferences through step-level Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which serves as the Q-value model. During inference, at each decision-making step, LLM agents select the action with the highest Q value before interacting with the environment. We apply our method to various open-source and API-based LLM agents, demonstrating that Q-value models significantly improve their performance. Notably, the performance of the agent built with Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct improved by 103% on WebShop and 75% on HotPotQA when enhanced with Q-value models, even surpassing GPT-4o-mini.

Lee, Ziwei Zhu, Balassubramanian Srinivasan",2024-08-29,"The United States has experienced a significant increase in violent extremism, prompting the need for automated tools to detect and limit the spread of extremist ideology online. This study evaluates the performance of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in detecting and classifying online domestic extremist posts. We collected social media posts containing ""far-right"" and ""far-left"" ideological keywords and manually labeled them as extremist or non-extremist. Extremist posts were further classified into one or more of five contributing elements of extremism based on a working definitional framework. The BERT model's performance was evaluated based on training data size and knowledge transfer between categories. We also compared the performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models using different prompts: na\""ive, layperson-definition, role-playing, and professional-definition. Results showed that the best performing GPT models outperformed the best performing BERT models, with more detailed prompts generally yielding better results. However, overly complex prompts may impair performance. Different versions of GPT have unique sensitives to what they consider extremist. GPT 3.5 performed better at classifying far-left extremist posts, while GPT 4 performed better at classifying far-right extremist posts. Large language models, represented by GPT models, hold significant potential for online extremism classification tasks, surpassing traditional BERT models in a zero-shot setting.

We conduct experiments in both classification and regression tasks with LLMs in various sizes (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT and LLaMA-2). Our findings emphasize the effectiveness and robustness of text-based feature selection methods and showcase their potentials using a real-world medical application. We also discuss the challenges and future opportunities in employing LLMs for feature selection, offering insights for further research and development in this emerging field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12025v2,cs.AI
Probabilistic Medical Predictions of Large Language Models,"Bowen Gu, Rishi J. Desai, Kueiyu Joshua Lin, Jie Yang",2024-08-21,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical applications through prompt engineering, allowing flexible clinical predictions. However, they struggle to produce reliable prediction probabilities, which are crucial for transparency and decision-making. While explicit prompts can lead LLMs to generate probability estimates, their numerical reasoning limitations raise concerns about reliability. We compared explicit probabilities from text generation to implicit probabilities derived from the likelihood of predicting the correct label token. Across six advanced open-source LLMs and five medical datasets, explicit probabilities consistently underperformed implicit probabilities in discrimination, precision, and recall. This discrepancy is more pronounced with smaller LLMs and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation, improved probability estimation methods, and further research for clinical use of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11316v2,cs.AI
Applying and Evaluating Large Language Models in Mental Health Care: A Scoping Review of Human-Assessed Generative Tasks,"Yining Hua, Hongbin Na, Zehan Li, Fenglin Liu, Xiao Fang, David Clifton, John Torous",2024-08-21,"Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for mental health care, offering scalable support through their ability to generate human-like responses. However, the effectiveness of these models in clinical settings remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to assess the current generative applications of LLMs in mental health care, focusing on studies where these models were tested with human participants in real-world scenarios. A systematic search across APA PsycNet, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 726 unique articles, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. These studies encompassed applications such as clinical assistance, counseling, therapy, and emotional support. However, the evaluation methods were often non-standardized, with most studies relying on ad hoc scales that limit comparability and robustness. Privacy, safety, and fairness were also frequently underexplored. Moreover, reliance on proprietary models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, raises concerns about transparency and reproducibility. While LLMs show potential in expanding mental health care access, especially in underserved areas, the current evidence does not fully support their use as standalone interventions. More rigorous, standardized evaluations and ethical oversight are needed to ensure these tools can be safely and effectively integrated into clinical practice.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11288v1,cs.AI
Fine-Tuning a Local LLaMA-3 Large Language Model for Automated Privacy-Preserving Physician Letter Generation in Radiation Oncology,"Yihao Hou, Christoph Bert, Ahmed Gomaa, Godehard Lahmer, Daniel Hoefler, Thomas Weissmann, Raphaela Voigt, Philipp Schubert, Charlotte Schmitter, Alina Depardon, Sabine Semrau, Andreas Maier, Rainer Fietkau, Yixing Huang, Florian Putz",2024-08-20,"Generating physician letters is a time-consuming task in daily clinical practice. This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style. ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the 8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories, recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a 4-point scale). With careful physician review and correction, automated LLM-based physician letter generation has significant practical value.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10715v1,cs.AI
Investigating Context Effects in Similarity Judgements in Large Language Models,"Sagar Uprety, Amit Kumar Jaiswal, Haiming Liu, Dawei Song",2024-08-20,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the capability of AI models in comprehending and generating natural language text. They are increasingly being used to empower and deploy agents in real-world scenarios, which make decisions and take actions based on their understanding of the context. Therefore researchers, policy makers and enterprises alike are working towards ensuring that the decisions made by these agents align with human values and user expectations. That being said, human values and decisions are not always straightforward to measure and are subject to different cognitive biases. There is a vast section of literature in Behavioural Science which studies biases in human judgements. In this work we report an ongoing investigation on alignment of LLMs with human judgements affected by order bias. Specifically, we focus on a famous human study which showed evidence of order effects in similarity judgements, and replicate it with various popular LLMs. We report the different settings where LLMs exhibit human-like order effect bias and discuss the implications of these findings to inform the design and development of LLM based applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10711v1,cs.AI
Simulating Field Experiments with Large Language Models,"Yaoyu Chen, Yuheng Hu, Yingda Lu",2024-08-19,"Prevailing large language models (LLMs) are capable of human responses simulation through its unprecedented content generation and reasoning abilities. However, it is not clear whether and how to leverage LLMs to simulate field experiments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two prompting strategies: the observer mode that allows a direct prediction on main conclusions and the participant mode that simulates distributions of responses from participants. Using this approach, we examine fifteen well cited field experimental papers published in INFORMS and MISQ, finding encouraging alignments between simulated experimental results and the actual results in certain scenarios. We further identify topics of which LLMs underperform, including gender difference and social norms related research. Additionally, the automatic and standardized workflow proposed in this paper enables the possibility of a large-scale screening of more papers with field experiments. This paper pioneers the utilization of large language models (LLMs) for simulating field experiments, presenting a significant extension to previous work which focused solely on lab environments. By introducing two novel prompting strategies, observer and participant modes, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to both predict outcomes and replicate participant responses within complex field settings. Our findings indicate a promising alignment with actual experimental results in certain scenarios, achieving a stimulation accuracy of 66% in observer mode. This study expands the scope of potential applications for LLMs and illustrates their utility in assisting researchers prior to engaging in expensive field experiments. Moreover, it sheds light on the boundaries of LLMs when used in simulating field experiments, serving as a cautionary note for researchers considering the integration of LLMs into their experimental toolkit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09682v1,cs.AI

Plan with Code: Comparing approaches for robust NL to DSL generation,"Nastaran Bassamzadeh, Chhaya Methani",2024-08-15,"Planning in code is considered a more reliable approach for many orchestration tasks.

Can Large Language Models Reason?

However, recent works have shown that LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts, sparking skepticism. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07215v2,cs.AI

LLMs' Understanding of Natural Language Revealed,Walid S. Saba,2024-07-29,"Large language models (LLMs) are the result of a massive experiment in bottom-up, data-driven reverse engineering of language at scale. Despite their utility in a number of downstream NLP tasks, ample research has shown that LLMs are incapable of performing reasoning in tasks that require quantification over and the manipulation of symbolic variables (e.g., planning and problem solving); see for example [25][26]. In this document, however, we will focus on testing LLMs for their language understanding capabilities, their supposed forte. As we will show here, the language understanding capabilities of LLMs have been widely exaggerated. While LLMs have proven to generate human-like coherent language (since that's how they were designed), their language understanding capabilities have not been properly tested. In particular, we believe that the language understanding capabilities of LLMs should be tested by performing an operation that is the opposite of 'text generation' and specifically by giving the LLM snippets of text as input and then querying what the LLM ""understood"". As we show here, when doing so it will become apparent that LLMs do not truly understand language, beyond very superficial inferences that are essentially the byproduct of the memorization of massive amounts of ingested text.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19630v2,cs.AI

Human-artificial intelligence teaming for scientific information extraction from data-driven additive manufacturing research using large language models,"Mutahar Safdar, Jiarui Xie, Andrei Mircea, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao",2024-07-26,"Data-driven research in Additive Manufacturing (AM) has gained significant success in recent years. This has led to a plethora of scientific literature to emerge. The knowledge in these works consists of AM and Artificial Intelligence (AI) contexts that have not been mined and formalized in an integrated way. It requires substantial effort and time to extract scientific information from these works. AM domain experts have contributed over two dozen review papers to summarize these works. However, information specific to AM and AI contexts still requires manual effort to extract. The recent success of foundation models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) or GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) on textual data has opened the possibility of expediting scientific information extraction. We propose a framework that enables collaboration between AM and AI experts to continuously extract scientific information from data-driven AM literature. A demonstration tool is implemented based on the proposed framework and a case study is conducted to extract information relevant to the datasets, modeling, sensing, and AM system categories.

ClinicRealm: Re-evaluating Large Language Models with Conventional Machine Learning for Non-Generative Clinical Prediction Tasks,"Yinghao Zhu, Junyi Gao, Zixiang Wang, Weibin Liao, Xiaochen Zheng, Lifang Liang, Miguel O. Bernabeu, Yasha Wang, Lequan Yu, Chengwei Pan, Ewen M. Harrison, Liantao Ma",2024-07-26,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medicine. However, their utility in non-generative clinical prediction, often presumed inferior to specialized models, remains under-evaluated, leading to ongoing debate within the field and potential for misuse, misunderstanding, or over-reliance due to a lack of systematic benchmarking. Our ClinicRealm study addresses this by benchmarking 9 GPT-based LLMs, 5 BERT-based models, and 7 traditional methods on unstructured clinical notes and structured Electronic Health Records (EHR). Key findings reveal a significant shift: for clinical note predictions, leading LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1/V3, GPT o3-mini-high) in zero-shot settings now decisively outperform finetuned BERT models. On structured EHRs, while specialized models excel with ample data, advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1/V3) show potent zero-shot capabilities, often surpassing conventional models in data-scarce settings. Notably, leading open-source LLMs can match or exceed proprietary counterparts. These results establish modern LLMs as powerful non-generative clinical prediction tools, particularly with unstructured text and offering data-efficient structured data options, thus necessitating a re-evaluation of model selection strategies. This research should serve as an important insight for medical informaticists, AI developers, and clinical researchers, potentially prompting a reassessment of current assumptions and inspiring new approaches to LLM application in predictive healthcare.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18525v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG"

Optimal Decision Making Through Scenario Simulations Using Large Language Models,"Sumedh Rasal, E. J. Hauer",2024-07-09,"The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly expanded their application across diverse domains, transforming how complex problems are approached and solved. Initially conceived to predict subsequent words in texts, these models have transcended their original design to comprehend and respond to the underlying contexts of queries. Today, LLMs routinely perform tasks that once seemed formidable, such as writing essays, poems, stories, and even developing software code. As their capabilities continue to grow, so too do the expectations of their performance in even more sophisticated domains. Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options. These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs. This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap. By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process. This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria. By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06486v2,cs.AI

We present llm.npu, the first LLM inference system utilizing on-device Neural Processing Unit (NPU) offloading to reduce prefill latency. llm.npu enhances NPU offloading efficiency by re-constructing the prompt and model in three levels: (1) At prompt level, it divides variable-length prompts into multiple fixed-sized chunks while maintaining data dependencies; (2) At tensor level, it identifies and extracts significant outliers to run on the CPU/GPU in parallel with minimal overhead; (3) At block level, it schedules Transformer blocks in an out-of-order manner to the CPU/GPU and NPU based on their hardware affinity and sensitivity to accuracy. Compared to competitive baselines, llm.npu achieves 22.4x faster prefill speed and 30.7$\times$ energy savings on average, and up to 32.8x speedup in an end-to-end real-world application.

Vempala",2024-06-20,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) perform (and sometimes excel at) more and more complex cognitive tasks, a natural question is whether AI really understands. The study of understanding in LLMs is in its infancy, and the community has yet to incorporate well-trodden research in philosophy, psychology, and education. We initiate this, specifically focusing on understanding algorithms, and propose a hierarchy of levels of understanding. We use the hierarchy to design and conduct a study with human subjects (undergraduate and graduate students) as well as large language models (generations of GPT), revealing interesting similarities and differences. We expect that our rigorous criteria will be useful to keep track of AI's progress in such cognitive domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14722v3,"cs.AI, I.2.m; F.1.1"
APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking,"Can Jin, Hongwu Peng, Shiyu Zhao, Zhenting Wang, Wujiang Xu, Ligong Han, Jiahui Zhao, Kai Zhong, Sanguthevar Rajasekaran, Dimitris N. Metaxas",2024-06-20,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v2,cs.AI
A Pure Transformer Pretraining Framework on Text-attributed Graphs,"Yu Song, Haitao Mao, Jiachen Xiao, Jingzhe Liu, Zhikai Chen, Wei Jin, Carl Yang, Jiliang Tang, Hui Liu",2024-06-19,"Pretraining plays a pivotal role in acquiring generalized knowledge from large-scale data, achieving remarkable successes as evidenced by large models in CV and NLP. However, progress in the graph domain remains limited due to fundamental challenges such as feature heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity. Recently, increasing efforts have been made to enhance node feature quality with Large Language Models (LLMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), demonstrating superiority to traditional bag-of-words or word2vec techniques. These high-quality node features reduce the previously critical role of graph structure, resulting in a modest performance gap between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and structure-agnostic Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Motivated by this, we introduce a feature-centric pretraining perspective by treating graph structure as a prior and leveraging the rich, unified feature space to learn refined interaction patterns that generalizes across graphs. Our framework, Graph Sequence Pretraining with Transformer (GSPT), samples node contexts through random walks and employs masked feature reconstruction to capture pairwise proximity in the LLM-unified feature space using a standard Transformer. By utilizing unified text representations rather than varying structures, our framework achieves significantly better transferability among graphs within the same domain. GSPT can be easily adapted to both node classification and link prediction, demonstrating promising empirical success on various datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13873v1,cs.AI
Leveraging Large Language Models for Patient Engagement: The Power of Conversational AI in Digital Health,"Bo Wen, Raquel Norel, Julia Liu, Thaddeus Stappenbeck, Farhana Zulkernine, Huamin Chen",2024-06-19,"The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for transforming patient engagement in healthcare through conversational AI. This paper presents an overview of the current landscape of LLMs in healthcare, specifically focusing on their applications in analyzing and generating conversations for improved patient engagement. We showcase the power of LLMs in handling unstructured conversational data through four case studies: (1) analyzing mental health discussions on Reddit, (2) developing a personalized chatbot for cognitive engagement in seniors, (3) summarizing medical conversation datasets, and (4) designing an AI-powered patient engagement system. These case studies demonstrate how LLMs can effectively extract insights and summarizations from unstructured dialogues and engage patients in guided, goal-oriented conversations. Leveraging LLMs for conversational analysis and generation opens new doors for many patient-centered outcomes research opportunities. However, integrating LLMs into healthcare raises important ethical considerations regarding data privacy, bias, transparency, and regulatory compliance.

Enhancing Travel Choice Modeling with Large Language Models: A Prompt-Learning Approach,"Xuehao Zhai, Hanlin Tian, Lintong Li, Tianyu Zhao",2024-06-19,"Travel choice analysis is crucial for understanding individual travel behavior to develop appropriate transport policies and recommendation systems in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Despite extensive research, this domain faces two critical challenges: a) modeling with limited survey data, and b) simultaneously achieving high model explainability and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel prompt-learning-based Large Language Model(LLM) framework that significantly improves prediction accuracy and provides explicit explanations for individual predictions. This framework involves three main steps: transforming input variables into textual form; building of demonstrations similar to the object, and applying these to a well-trained LLM. We tested the framework's efficacy using two widely used choice datasets: London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC) and Optima-Mode collected in Switzerland.

Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models in Medicine,"Yifan Yang, Qiao Jin, Furong Huang, Zhiyong Lu",2024-06-18,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare applications offers promising advancements in medical diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care. However, the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial attacks poses a significant threat, potentially leading to harmful outcomes in delicate medical contexts. This study investigates the vulnerability of LLMs to two types of adversarial attacks in three medical tasks. Utilizing real-world patient data, we demonstrate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs are susceptible to manipulation across multiple tasks. This research further reveals that domain-specific tasks demand more adversarial data in model fine-tuning than general domain tasks for effective attack execution, especially for more capable models. We discover that while integrating adversarial data does not markedly degrade overall model performance on medical benchmarks, it does lead to noticeable shifts in fine-tuned model weights, suggesting a potential pathway for detecting and countering model attacks. This research highlights the urgent need for robust security measures and the development of defensive mechanisms to safeguard LLMs in medical applications, to ensure their safe and effective deployment in healthcare settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12259v3,cs.AI

Unlocking Large Language Model's Planning Capabilities with Maximum Diversity Fine-tuning,"Wenjun Li, Changyu Chen, Pradeep Varakantham",2024-06-15,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive task-solving capabilities through prompting techniques and system designs, including solving planning tasks (e.g., math proofs, basic travel planning) when sufficient data is available online and used during pre-training. However, for planning tasks with limited prior data (e.g., blocks world, advanced travel planning), the performance of LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT and Gemini, is poor. This paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning on the planning capabilities of LLMs, revealing that LLMs can achieve strong performance in planning through substantial (tens of thousands of specific examples) fine-tuning. Yet, this process incurs high economic, time, and computational costs for each planning problem variation. To address this, we propose Clustering-Based Maximum Diversity Sampling (CMDS), which selects diverse and representative data to enhance sample efficiency and the model's generalization capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CMDS-l, a baseline method combining CMDS with language embeddings, outperforms random sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm, CMDS-g, which encodes planning task instances with their graph representations into the embedding space.

TRIP-PAL: Travel Planning with Guarantees by Combining Large Language Models and Automated Planners,"Tomas de la Rosa, Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Alberto Pozanco, Zhen Zeng, Daniel Borrajo",2024-06-14,"Travel planning is a complex task that involves generating a sequence of actions related to visiting places subject to constraints and maximizing some user satisfaction criteria. Traditional approaches rely on problem formulation in a given formal language, extracting relevant travel information from web sources, and use an adequate problem solver to generate a valid solution. As an alternative, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based approaches directly output plans from user requests using language. Although LLMs possess extensive travel domain knowledge and provide high-level information like points of interest and potential routes, current state-of-the-art models often generate plans that lack coherence, fail to satisfy constraints fully, and do not guarantee the generation of high-quality solutions. We propose TRIP-PAL, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of LLMs and automated planners, where (i) LLMs get and translate travel information and user information into data structures that can be fed into planners; and (ii) automated planners generate travel plans that guarantee constraint satisfaction and optimize for users' utility.

Annotation Guidelines-Based Knowledge Augmentation: Towards Enhancing Large Language Models for Educational Text Classification,"Shiqi Liu, Sannyuya Liu, Lele Sha, Zijie Zeng, Dragan Gasevic, Zhi Liu",2024-06-03,"Various machine learning approaches have gained significant popularity for the automated classification of educational text to identify indicators of learning engagement -- i.e. learning engagement classification (LEC). LEC can offer comprehensive insights into human learning processes, attracting significant interest from diverse research communities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their comprehensive evaluation and improvement approaches in LEC tasks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based Knowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to retrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then applies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which includes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and urgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and cognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results demonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and Llama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT 4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex semantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination based on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source GPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels with similar names in multi-class classification.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00954v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
Generative AI Voting: Fair Collective Choice is Resilient to LLM Biases and Inconsistencies,"Srijoni Majumdar, Edith Elkind, Evangelos Pournaras",2024-05-31,"Scaling up deliberative and voting participation is a longstanding endeavor -- a cornerstone for direct democracy and legitimate collective choice. Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) unravel new capabilities for AI personal assistants to overcome cognitive bandwidth limitations of humans, providing decision support or even direct representation of human voters at large scale. However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision-making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating with high realism more than >50K LLM voting personas in 306 real-world voting elections, we disentangle the nature of different biases in LLMS (GPT 3, GPT 3.5, and Llama2). Complex preferential ballot formats exhibit significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections that show higher consistency. Strikingly though, by demonstrating for the first time in real-world a proportional representation of voters in direct democracy, we are also able to show that fair ballot aggregation methods, such as equal shares, prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans with fairer AI representation, especially for voters who are likely to abstain. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for democratic resilience in progressives scenarios with low voters turnout and voter fatigue supported by AI representatives: abstained voters are mitigated by recovering highly representative voting outcomes that are fairer. These interdisciplinary insights provide remarkable foundations for science, policymakers, and citizens to develop safeguards and resilience for AI risks in democratic innovations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11871v4,cs.AI
Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models,"Yuxiao Luo, Zhongcai Cao, Xin Jin, Kang Liu, Ling Yin",2024-05-30,"Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19850v1,cs.AI
Knowledge Graph Tuning: Real-time Large Language Model Personalization based on Human Feedback,"Jingwei Sun, Zhixu Du, Yiran Chen",2024-05-30,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks. Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs. To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions. Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs. In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters. Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs. Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19686v1,cs.AI
Leveraging Open-Source Large Language Models for encoding Social Determinants of Health using an Intelligent Router,"Akul Goel, Surya Narayanan Hari, Belinda Waltman, Matt Thomson",2024-05-30,"Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) play a significant role in patient health outcomes. The Center of Disease Control (CDC) introduced a subset of ICD-10 codes called Z-codes in an attempt to officially recognize and measure SDOH in the health care system. However, these codes are rarely annotated in a patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR), and instead, in many cases, need to be inferred from clinical notes. Previous research has shown that large language models (LLMs) show promise on extracting unstructured data from EHRs. However, with thousands of models to choose from with unique architectures and training sets, it's difficult to choose one model that performs the best on coding tasks. Further, clinical notes contain trusted health information making the use of closed-source language models from commercial vendors difficult, so the identification of open source LLMs that can be run within health organizations and exhibits high performance on SDOH tasks is an urgent problem. Here, we introduce an intelligent routing system for SDOH coding that uses a language model router to direct medical record data to open source LLMs that demonstrate optimal performance on specific SDOH codes. The intelligent routing system exhibits state of the art performance of 97.4% accuracy averaged across 5 codes, including homelessness and food insecurity, on par with closed models such as GPT-4o. In order to train the routing system and validate models, we also introduce a synthetic data generation and validation paradigm to increase the scale of training data without needing privacy protected medical records. Together, we demonstrate an architecture for intelligent routing of inputs to task-optimal language models to achieve high performance across a set of medical coding sub-tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19631v1,cs.AI
SSFF: Investigating LLM Predictive Capabilities for Startup Success through a Multi-Agent Framework with Enhanced Explainability and Performance,"Xisen Wang, Yigit Ihlamur, Fuat Alican",2024-05-29,"LLM based agents have recently demonstrated strong potential in automating complex tasks, yet accurately predicting startup success remains an open challenge with few benchmarks and tailored frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose the Startup Success Forecasting Framework, an autonomous system that emulates the reasoning of venture capital analysts through a multi agent collaboration model. Our framework integrates traditional machine learning methods such as random forests and neural networks within a retrieval augmented generation framework composed of three interconnected modules: a prediction block, an analysis block, and an external knowledge block. We evaluate our framework and identify three main findings. First, by leveraging founder segmentation, startups led by L5 founders are 3.79 times more likely to succeed than those led by L1 founders. Second, baseline large language models consistently overpredict startup success and struggle under realistic class imbalances largely due to overreliance on founder claims. Third, our framework significantly enhances prediction accuracy, yielding a 108.3 percent relative improvement over GPT 4o mini and a 30.8 percent relative improvement over GPT 4o. These results demonstrate the value of a multi agent approach combined with discriminative machine learning in mitigating the limitations of standard large language model based prediction methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19456v2,cs.AI

Yet, addressing complex urban and environmental management problems normally requires in-depth domain science and informatics expertise. This expertise is essential for deriving data and simulation-driven for informed decision support. In this context, we investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). By adopting ChatGPT API as the reasoning core, we outline an integrated workflow that encompasses natural language processing, methontology-based prompt tuning, and transformers. This workflow automates the creation of scenario-based ontology using existing research articles and technical manuals of urban datasets and simulations. The outcomes of our methodology are knowledge graphs in widely adopted ontology languages (e.g., OWL, RDF, SPARQL). These facilitate the development of urban decision support systems by enhancing the data and metadata modeling, the integration of complex datasets, the coupling of multi-domain simulation models, and the formulation of decision-making metrics and workflow. The feasibility of our methodology is evaluated through a comparative analysis that juxtaposes our AI-generated ontology with the well-known Pizza Ontology employed in tutorials for popular ontology software (e.g., prot\'eg\'e).

Genshin: General Shield for Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models,"Xiao Peng, Tao Liu, Ying Wang",2024-05-29,"Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or LLaMA have been trending recently, demonstrating considerable advancement and generalizability power in countless domains. However, LLMs create an even bigger black box exacerbating opacity, with interpretability limited to few approaches. The uncertainty and opacity embedded in LLMs' nature restrict their application in high-stakes domains like financial fraud, phishing, etc. Current approaches mainly rely on traditional textual classification with posterior interpretable algorithms, suffering from attackers who may create versatile adversarial samples to break the system's defense, forcing users to make trade-offs between efficiency and robustness. To address this issue, we propose a novel cascading framework called Genshin (General Shield for Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models), utilizing LLMs as defensive one-time plug-ins. Unlike most applications of LLMs that try to transform text into something new or structural, Genshin uses LLMs to recover text to its original state. Genshin aims to combine the generalizability of the LLM, the discrimination of the median model, and the interpretability of the simple model. Our experiments on the task of sentimental analysis and spam detection have shown fatal flaws of the current median models and exhilarating results on LLMs' recovery ability, demonstrating that Genshin is both effective and efficient. In our ablation study, we unearth several intriguing observations. Utilizing the LLM defender, a tool derived from the 4th paradigm, we have reproduced BERT's 15% optimal mask rate results in the 3rd paradigm of NLP. Additionally, when employing the LLM as a potential adversarial tool, attackers are capable of executing effective attacks that are nearly semantically lossless.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18741v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via Layer-specific Editing,"Wei Zhao, Zhe Li, Yige Li, Ye Zhang, Jun Sun",2024-05-28,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in a wide range of real-world applications. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial prompts even when aligned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or supervised fine-tuning. While existing defense methods focus on either detecting harmful prompts or reducing the likelihood of harmful responses through various means, defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks based on the inner mechanisms of LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how LLMs response to harmful prompts and propose a novel defense method termed \textbf{L}ayer-specific \textbf{Ed}iting (LED) to enhance the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Through LED, we reveal that several critical \textit{safety layers} exist among the early layers of LLMs. We then show that realigning these safety layers (and some selected additional layers) with the decoded safe response from selected target layers can significantly improve the alignment of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments across various LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Mistral) show the effectiveness of LED, which effectively defends against jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign prompts.

LLM+Reasoning+Planning for Supporting Incomplete User Queries in Presence of APIs,"Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy, David H. Alonso, Prarit Lamba",2024-05-21,"Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API ""get_info_api"" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12433v3,cs.AI

We developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for social dynamics and introduced two evaluation tasks: Inverse Reasoning (IR) and Inverse Inverse Planning (IIP). Our approach also encompassed a computational model based on recursive Bayesian inference, adept at elucidating diverse human behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses revealed that humans surpassed the latest GPT models in overall performance, zero-shot learning, one-shot generalization, and adaptability to multi-modalities. Notably, GPT models demonstrated social intelligence only at the most basic order (order = 0), in stark contrast to human social intelligence (order >= 2).

Our goal is to label behaviors corresponding to autism criteria and improve model accuracy with synthetic training data.

Analyzing Narrative Processing in Large Language Models (LLMs): Using GPT4 to test BERT,"Patrick Krauss, Jannik Hösch, Claus Metzner, Andreas Maier, Peter Uhrig, Achim Schilling",2024-05-03,"The ability to transmit and receive complex information via language is unique to humans and is the basis of traditions, culture and versatile social interactions. Through the disruptive introduction of transformer based large language models (LLMs) humans are not the only entity to ""understand"" and produce language any more. In the present study, we have performed the first steps to use LLMs as a model to understand fundamental mechanisms of language processing in neural networks, in order to make predictions and generate hypotheses on how the human brain does language processing. Thus, we have used ChatGPT to generate seven different stylistic variations of ten different narratives (Aesop's fables). We used these stories as input for the open source LLM BERT and have analyzed the activation patterns of the hidden units of BERT using multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis. We found that the activation vectors of the hidden units cluster according to stylistic variations in earlier layers of BERT (1) than narrative content (4-5). Despite the fact that BERT consists of 12 identical building blocks that are stacked and trained on large text corpora, the different layers perform different tasks. This is a very useful model of the human brain, where self-similar structures, i.e. different areas of the cerebral cortex, can have different functions and are therefore well suited to processing language in a very efficient way. The proposed approach has the potential to open the black box of LLMs on the one hand, and might be a further step to unravel the neural processes underlying human language processing and cognition in general.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02024v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

GPT-4 passes most of the 297 written Polish Board Certification Examinations,"Jakub Pokrywka, Jeremi Kaczmarek, Edward Gorzelańczyk",2024-04-29,"Introduction: Recently, the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased rapidly, allowing them to be used in a great number of applications. However, the risks posed by the generation of false information through LLMs significantly limit their applications in sensitive areas such as healthcare, highlighting the necessity for rigorous validations to determine their utility and reliability. To date, no study has extensively compared the performance of LLMs on Polish medical examinations across a broad spectrum of specialties on a very large dataset. Objectives: This study evaluated the performance of three Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models on the Polish Board Certification Exam (Pa\'nstwowy Egzamin Specjalizacyjny, PES) dataset, which consists of 297 tests. Methods: We developed a software program to download and process PES exams and tested the performance of GPT models using OpenAI Application Programming Interface. Results: Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 did not pass any of the analyzed exams. In contrast, the GPT-4 models demonstrated the capability to pass the majority of the exams evaluated, with the most recent model, gpt-4-0125, successfully passing 222 (75%) of them.

Enhancing Legal Compliance and Regulation Analysis with Large Language Models,Shabnam Hassani,2024-04-26,"This research explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the extraction of requirement-related legal content in the food safety domain and checking legal compliance of regulatory artifacts. With Industry 4.0 revolutionizing the food industry and with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) reshaping privacy policies and data processing agreements, there is a growing gap between regulatory analysis and recent technological advancements. This study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging LLMs, namely BERT and GPT models, to accurately classify legal provisions and automate compliance checks. Our findings demonstrate promising results, indicating LLMs' significant potential to enhance legal compliance and regulatory analysis efficiency, notably by reducing manual workload and improving accuracy within reasonable time and financial constraints.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17522v1,"cs.SE, cs.AI"
BERT vs GPT for financial engineering,"Edward Sharkey, Philip Treleaven",2024-04-24,"The paper benchmarks several Transformer models [4], to show how these models can judge sentiment from a news event. This signal can then be used for downstream modelling and signal identification for commodity trading. We find that fine-tuned BERT models outperform fine-tuned or vanilla GPT models on this task. Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and natural language generation. Among the most prominent transformer models are Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which differ in their architectures and objectives. A CopBERT model training data and process overview is provided. The CopBERT model outperforms similar domain specific BERT trained models such as FinBERT. The below confusion matrices show the performance on CopBERT & CopGPT respectively. We see a ~10 percent increase in f1_score when compare CopBERT vs GPT4 and 16 percent increase vs CopGPT. Whilst GPT4 is dominant It highlights the importance of considering alternatives to GPT models for financial engineering tasks, given risks of hallucinations, and challenges with interpretability. We unsurprisingly see the larger LLMs outperform the BERT models, with predictive power. In summary BERT is partially the new XGboost, what it lacks in predictive power it provides with higher levels of interpretability. Concluding that BERT models might not be the next XGboost [2], but represent an interesting alternative for financial engineering tasks, that require a blend of interpretability and accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12990v1,"q-fin.ST, cs.AI, cs.CL"
LLM-Personalize: Aligning LLM Planners with Human Preferences via Reinforced Self-Training for Housekeeping Robots,"Dongge Han, Trevor McInroe, Adam Jelley, Stefano V. Albrecht, Peter Bell, Amos Storkey",2024-04-22,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

Performance metrics included micro-average exact match precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed other models in F1 scores across all relation types. Overall, it achieved the highest micro-average F1 score of 0.92.

Can only LLMs do Reasoning?: Potential of Small Language Models in Task Planning,"Gawon Choi, Hyemin Ahn",2024-04-05,"In robotics, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming prevalent, especially for understanding human commands. In particular, LLMs are utilized as domain-agnostic task planners for high-level human commands. LLMs are capable of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and this allows LLMs to be task planners. However, we need to consider that modern robots still struggle to perform complex actions, and the domains where robots can be deployed are limited in practice. This leads us to pose a question: If small LMs can be trained to reason in chains within a single domain, would even small LMs be good task planners for the robots?

Instruction-Driven Game Engines on Large Language Models,"Hongqiu Wu, Yan Wang, Xingyuan Liu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang",2024-03-30,"The Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) project aims to democratize game development by enabling a large language model (LLM) to follow free-form game rules and autonomously generate game-play processes. The IDGE allows users to create games by issuing simple natural language instructions, which significantly lowers the barrier for game development. We approach the learning process for IDGEs as a Next State Prediction task, wherein the model autoregressively predicts in-game states given player actions. It is a challenging task because the computation of in-game states must be precise; otherwise, slight errors could disrupt the game-play. To address this, we train the IDGE in a curriculum manner that progressively increases the model's exposure to complex scenarios. Our initial progress lies in developing an IDGE for Poker, a universally cherished card game. The engine we've designed not only supports a wide range of poker variants but also allows for high customization of rules through natural language inputs. Furthermore, it also favors rapid prototyping of new games from minimal samples, proposing an innovative paradigm in game development that relies on minimal prompt and data engineering. This work lays the groundwork for future advancements in instruction-driven game creation, potentially transforming how games are designed and played.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00276v4,cs.AI
Enhancing the General Agent Capabilities of Low-Parameter LLMs through Tuning and Multi-Branch Reasoning,"Qinhao Zhou, Zihan Zhang, Xiang Xiang, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Yongbin Li",2024-03-29,"Open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong language understanding and generation capabilities, making them highly successful in a variety of tasks.

A Review of Multi-Modal Large Language and Vision Models,"Kilian Carolan, Laura Fennelly, Alan F. Smeaton",2024-03-28,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a focal point of research and application, driven by their unprecedented ability to understand and generate text with human-like quality. Even more recently, LLMs have been extended into multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) which extends their capabilities to deal with image, video and audio information, in addition to text. This opens up applications like text-to-video generation, image captioning, text-to-speech, and more and is achieved either by retro-fitting an LLM with multi-modal capabilities, or building a MM-LLM from scratch. This paper provides an extensive review of the current state of those LLMs with multi-modal capabilities as well as the very recent MM-LLMs. It covers the historical development of LLMs especially the advances enabled by transformer-based architectures like OpenAI's GPT series and Google's BERT, as well as the role of attention mechanisms in enhancing model performance. The paper includes coverage of the major and most important of the LLMs and MM-LLMs and also covers the techniques of model tuning, including fine-tuning and prompt engineering, which tailor pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains. Ethical considerations and challenges, such as data bias and model misuse, are also analysed to underscore the importance of responsible AI development and deployment. Finally, we discuss the implications of open-source versus proprietary models in AI research. Through this review, we provide insights into the transformative potential of MM-LLMs in various applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01322v1,"cs.CL, cs.AI"
LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models,"Mingxing Peng, Xusen Guo, Xianda Chen, Meixin Zhu, Kehua Chen",2024-03-27,"To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v2,cs.AI
Exploring the Privacy Protection Capabilities of Chinese Large Language Models,"Yuqi Yang, Xiaowen Huang, Jitao Sang",2024-03-27,"Large language models (LLMs), renowned for their impressive capabilities in various tasks, have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. Yet, these advancements have raised growing concerns about privacy and security implications. To address these issues and explain the risks inherent in these models, we have devised a three-tiered progressive framework tailored for evaluating privacy in language systems. This framework consists of progressively complex and in-depth privacy test tasks at each tier. Our primary objective is to comprehensively evaluate the sensitivity of large language models to private information, examining how effectively they discern, manage, and safeguard sensitive data in diverse scenarios. This systematic evaluation helps us understand the degree to which these models comply with privacy protection guidelines and the effectiveness of their inherent safeguards against privacy breaches. Our observations indicate that existing Chinese large language models universally show privacy protection shortcomings.

Addressing Social Misattributions of Large Language Models: An HCXAI-based Approach,"Andrea Ferrario, Alberto Termine, Alessandro Facchini",2024-03-26,"Human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) advocates for the integration of social aspects into AI explanations. Central to the HCXAI discourse is the Social Transparency (ST) framework, which aims to make the socio-organizational context of AI systems accessible to their users. In this work, we suggest extending the ST framework to address the risks of social misattributions in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in sensitive areas like mental health. In fact LLMs, which are remarkably capable of simulating roles and personas, may lead to mismatches between designers' intentions and users' perceptions of social attributes, risking to promote emotional manipulation and dangerous behaviors, cases of epistemic injustice, and unwarranted trust. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the ST framework with a fifth 'W-question' to clarify the specific social attributions assigned to LLMs by its designers and users. This addition aims to bridge the gap between LLM capabilities and user perceptions, promoting the ethically responsible development and use of LLM-based technology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17873v1,cs.AI
TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models,"David Bai, Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason",2024-03-25,"Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, such as concurrent actions between two agents when there are no conflicting conditions, without significant modification and definition to existing PDDL domains. A human expert aware of such constraints can decompose a goal into subgoals, each reachable through single agent planning, to take advantage of simultaneous actions. In contrast to classical planning, large language models (LLMs) directly used for inferring plan steps rarely guarantee execution success, but are capable of leveraging commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of both classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone, as well as most multiagent plans, while guaranteeing execution success.

Re2LLM: Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model for Session-based Recommendation,"Ziyan Wang, Yingpeng Du, Zhu Sun, Haoyan Chua, Kaidong Feng, Wenya Wang, Jie Zhang",2024-03-25,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR. However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations. Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones. To address such issues, we propose a Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently. In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs. To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors. To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent. It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16427v4,cs.AI

OntoClean, critical for assessing the metaphysical quality of ontologies, involves a two-step process of assigning meta-properties to classes and verifying a set of constraints. Manually conducting the first step proves difficult in practice, due to the need for philosophical expertise and lack of consensus among ontologists. By employing LLMs with two prompting strategies, the study demonstrates that high accuracy in the labelling process can be achieved.

Sphere Neural-Networks for Rational Reasoning,"Tiansi Dong, Mateja Jamnik, Pietro Liò",2024-03-22,"The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like communication, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training data, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic unification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297v4,cs.AI

Feedback-Generation for Programming Exercises With GPT-4,"Imen Azaiz, Natalie Kiesler, Sven Strickroth",2024-03-07,"Ever since Large Language Models (LLMs) and related applications have become broadly available, several studies investigated their potential for assisting educators and supporting students in higher education. LLMs such as Codex, GPT-3.5, and GPT 4 have shown promising results in the context of large programming courses, where students can benefit from feedback and hints if provided timely and at scale. This paper explores the quality of GPT-4 Turbo's generated output for prompts containing both the programming task specification and a student's submission as input. Two assignments from an introductory programming course were selected, and GPT-4 was asked to generate feedback for 55 randomly chosen, authentic student programming submissions. The output was qualitatively analyzed regarding correctness, personalization, fault localization, and other features identified in the material. Compared to prior work and analyses of GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo shows notable improvements. For example, the output is more structured and consistent. GPT-4 Turbo can also accurately identify invalid casing in student programs' output. In some cases, the feedback also includes the output of the student program.

Guiding Enumerative Program Synthesis with Large Language Models,"Yixuan Li, Julian Parsert, Elizabeth Polgreen",2024-03-06,"Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to dominate the discourse around automatic code generation with natural language specifications. In contrast, the best-performing synthesizers in the domain of formal synthesis with precise logical specifications are still based on enumerative algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the abilities of LLMs to solve formal synthesis benchmarks by carefully crafting a library of prompts for the domain. When one-shot synthesis fails, we propose a novel enumerative synthesis algorithm, which integrates calls to an LLM into a weighted probabilistic search. This allows the synthesizer to provide the LLM with information about the progress of the enumerator, and the LLM to provide the enumerator with syntactic guidance in an iterative loop. We evaluate our techniques on benchmarks from the Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) competition. We find that GPT-3.5 as a stand-alone tool for formal synthesis is easily outperformed by state-of-the-art formal synthesis algorithms, but our approach integrating the LLM into an enumerative synthesis algorithm shows significant performance gains over both the LLM and the enumerative synthesizer alone and the winning SyGuS competition tool.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03997v2,cs.AI
MedSafetyBench: Evaluating and Improving the Medical Safety of Large Language Models,"Tessa Han, Aounon Kumar, Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju",2024-03-06,"As large language models (LLMs) develop increasingly sophisticated capabilities and find applications in medical settings, it becomes important to assess their medical safety due to their far-reaching implications for personal and public health, patient safety, and human rights. However, there is little to no understanding of the notion of medical safety in the context of LLMs, let alone how to evaluate and improve it. To address this gap, we first define the notion of medical safety in LLMs based on the Principles of Medical Ethics set forth by the American Medical Association. We then leverage this understanding to introduce MedSafetyBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to measure the medical safety of LLMs. We demonstrate the utility of MedSafetyBench by using it to evaluate and improve the medical safety of LLMs. Our results show that publicly-available medical LLMs do not meet standards of medical safety and that fine-tuning them using MedSafetyBench improves their medical safety while preserving their medical performance. By introducing this new benchmark dataset, our work enables a systematic study of the state of medical safety in LLMs and motivates future work in this area, paving the way to mitigate the safety risks of LLMs in medicine.

Knowledge Graphs as Context Sources for LLM-Based Explanations of Learning Recommendations,"Hasan Abu-Rasheed, Christian Weber, Madjid Fathi",2024-03-05,"In the era of personalized education, the provision of comprehensible explanations for learning recommendations is of a great value to enhance the learner's understanding and engagement with the recommended learning content. Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in general have recently opened new doors for generating human-like explanations, for and along learning recommendations. However, their precision is still far away from acceptable in a sensitive field like education. To harness the abilities of LLMs, while still ensuring a high level of precision towards the intent of the learners, this paper proposes an approach to utilize knowledge graphs (KG) as a source of factual context, for LLM prompts, reducing the risk of model hallucinations, and safeguarding against wrong or imprecise information, while maintaining an application-intended learning context. We utilize the semantic relations in the knowledge graph to offer curated knowledge about learning recommendations. With domain-experts in the loop, we design the explanation as a textual template, which is filled and completed by the LLM. Domain experts were integrated in the prompt engineering phase as part of a study, to ensure that explanations include information that is relevant to the learner. We evaluate our approach quantitatively using Rouge-N and Rouge-L measures, as well as qualitatively with experts and learners. Our results show an enhanced recall and precision of the generated explanations compared to those generated solely by the GPT model, with a greatly reduced risk of generating imprecise information in the final learning explanation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03008v1,cs.AI

On the Roles of LLMs in Planning: Embedding LLMs into Planning Graphs,"Hankz Hankui Zhuo, Xin Chen, Rong Pan",2024-02-18,"Plan synthesis aims to generate a course of actions or policies to transit given initial states to goal states, provided domain models that could be designed by experts or learnt from training data or interactions with the world. Intrigued by the claims of emergent planning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), works have been proposed to investigate the planning effectiveness of LLMs, without considering any utilization of off-the-shelf planning techniques in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to further study the insight of the planning capability of LLMs by investigating the roles of LLMs in off-the-shelf planning frameworks. To do this, we investigate the effectiveness of embedding LLMs into one of the well-known planning frameworks, graph-based planning, proposing a novel LLMs-based planning framework with LLMs embedded in two levels of planning graphs, i.e., mutual constraints generation level and constraints solving level.

AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Timo Birr, Christoph Pohl, Abdelrahman Younes, Tamim Asfour",2024-02-16,"Recent advances in task planning leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities.

To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects.

AuditLLM: A Tool for Auditing Large Language Models Using Multiprobe Approach,"Maryam Amirizaniani, Elias Martin, Tanya Roosta, Aman Chadha, Chirag Shah",2024-02-14,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into various sectors, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This necessitates rigorous probing and auditing to maintain their effectiveness and trustworthiness in practical applications. Subjecting LLMs to varied iterations of a single query can unveil potential inconsistencies in their knowledge base or functional capacity. However, a tool for performing such audits with a easy to execute workflow, and low technical threshold is lacking. In this demo, we introduce ``AuditLLM,'' a novel tool designed to audit the performance of various LLMs in a methodical way. AuditLLM's primary function is to audit a given LLM by deploying multiple probes derived from a single question, thus detecting any inconsistencies in the model's comprehension or performance. A robust, reliable, and consistent LLM is expected to generate semantically similar responses to variably phrased versions of the same question. Building on this premise, AuditLLM generates easily interpretable results that reflect the LLM's consistency based on a single input question provided by the user. A certain level of inconsistency has been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other issues. One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues with the aforementioned LLM. To facilitate demonstration and practical uses, AuditLLM offers two key modes: (1) Live mode which allows instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries; and (2) Batch mode which facilitates comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis. This tool is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses, using a standardized auditing platform.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09334v2,cs.AI
Large Language Model with Graph Convolution for Recommendation,"Yingpeng Du, Ziyan Wang, Zhu Sun, Haoyan Chua, Hongzhi Liu, Zhonghai Wu, Yining Ma, Jie Zhang, Youchen Sun",2024-02-14,"In recent years, efforts have been made to use text information for better user profiling and item characterization in recommendations. However, text information can sometimes be of low quality, hindering its effectiveness for real-world applications. With knowledge and reasoning capabilities capsuled in Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing LLMs emerges as a promising way for description improvement. However, existing ways of prompting LLMs with raw texts ignore structured knowledge of user-item interactions, which may lead to hallucination problems like inconsistent description generation. To this end, we propose a Graph-aware Convolutional LLM method to elicit LLMs to capture high-order relations in the user-item graph. To adapt text-based LLMs with structured graphs, We use the LLM as an aggregator in graph processing, allowing it to understand graph-based information step by step. Specifically, the LLM is required for description enhancement by exploring multi-hop neighbors layer by layer, thereby propagating information progressively in the graph. To enable LLMs to capture large-scale graph information, we break down the description task into smaller parts, which drastically reduces the context length of the token input with each step. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08859v1,cs.AI

However, even LLMs specifically trained on medical topics may lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy for real-life applications. Methods: Using collective intelligence methods and a dataset of 200 clinical vignettes of real-life cases, we assessed and compared the accuracy of differential diagnoses obtained by asking individual commercial LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, Google PaLM 2, Cohere Command, Meta Llama 2) against the accuracy of differential diagnoses synthesized by aggregating responses from combinations of the same LLMs. Results: We find that aggregating responses from multiple, various LLMs leads to more accurate differential diagnoses (average accuracy for 3 LLMs: $75.3\%\pm 1.6pp$) compared to the differential diagnoses produced by single LLMs (average accuracy for single LLMs: $59.0\%\pm 6.1pp$). Discussion: The use of collective intelligence methods to synthesize differential diagnoses combining the responses of different LLMs achieves two of the necessary steps towards advancing acceptance of LLMs as a diagnostic support tool: (1) demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy and (2) eliminate dependence on a single commercial vendor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08806v1,"cs.AI, I.2.1; J.3"

GraphTranslator: Aligning Graph Model to Large Language Model for Open-ended Tasks,"Mengmei Zhang, Mingwei Sun, Peng Wang, Shen Fan, Yanhu Mo, Xiaoxiao Xu, Hong Liu, Cheng Yang, Chuan Shi",2024-02-11,"Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, exhibit powerful zero-shot and instruction-following capabilities, have catalyzed a revolutionary transformation across diverse fields, especially for open-ended tasks. While the idea is less explored in the graph domain, despite the availability of numerous powerful graph models (GMs), they are restricted to tasks in a pre-defined form. Although several methods applying LLMs to graphs have been proposed, they fail to simultaneously handle the pre-defined and open-ended tasks, with LLM as a node feature enhancer or as a standalone predictor. To break this dilemma, we propose to bridge the pretrained GM and LLM by a Translator, named GraphTranslator, aiming to leverage GM to handle the pre-defined tasks effectively and utilize the extended interface of LLMs to offer various open-ended tasks for GM. To train such Translator, we propose a Producer capable of constructing the graph-text alignment data along node information, neighbor information and model information. By translating node representation into tokens, GraphTranslator empowers an LLM to make predictions based on language instructions, providing a unified perspective for both pre-defined and open-ended tasks. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GraphTranslator on zero-shot node classification. The graph question answering experiments reveal our GraphTranslator potential across a broad spectrum of open-ended tasks through language instructions.

GLaM: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Domain Knowledge Graph Alignment via Neighborhood Partitioning and Generative Subgraph Encoding,"Stefan Dernbach, Khushbu Agarwal, Alejandro Zuniga, Michael Henry, Sutanay Choudhury",2024-02-09,"Integrating large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs derived from domain-specific data represents an important advancement towards more powerful and factual reasoning. As these models grow more capable, it is crucial to enable them to perform multi-step inferences over real-world knowledge graphs while minimizing hallucination. While large language models excel at conversation and text generation, their ability to reason over domain-specialized graphs of interconnected entities remains limited. For example, can we query a LLM to identify the optimal contact in a professional network for a specific goal, based on relationships and attributes in a private database? The answer is no--such capabilities lie beyond current methods. However, this question underscores a critical technical gap that must be addressed. Many high-value applications in areas such as science, security, and e-commerce rely on proprietary knowledge graphs encoding unique structures, relationships, and logical constraints. We introduce a fine-tuning framework for developing Graph-aligned LAnguage Models (GLaM) that transforms a knowledge graph into an alternate text representation with labeled question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that grounding the models in specific graph-based knowledge expands the models' capacity for structure-based reasoning. Our methodology leverages the large-language model's generative capabilities to create the dataset and proposes an efficient alternate to retrieval-augmented generation styled methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06764v3,cs.AI
"TIC: Translate-Infer-Compile for accurate ""text to plan"" using LLMs and Logical Representations","Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy",2024-02-09,"We study the problem of generating plans for given natural language planning task requests. On one hand, LLMs excel at natural language processing but do not perform well on planning. On the other hand, classical planning tools excel at planning tasks but require input in a structured language such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We leverage the strengths of both the techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for computing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06608v2,"cs.CL, cs.AI"

LB-KBQA: Large-language-model and BERT based Knowledge-Based Question and Answering System,"Yan Zhao, Zhongyun Li, Yushan Pan, Jiaxing Wang, Yihong Wang",2024-02-05,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), because of its emergent abilities, has empowered various fields, one typical of which is large language models (LLMs). One of the typical application fields of Generative AI is large language models (LLMs), and the natural language understanding capability of LLM is dramatically improved when compared with conventional AI-based methods. The natural language understanding capability has always been a barrier to the intent recognition performance of the Knowledge-Based-Question-and-Answer (KBQA) system, which arises from linguistic diversity and the newly appeared intent. Conventional AI-based methods for intent recognition can be divided into semantic parsing-based and model-based approaches. However, both of the methods suffer from limited resources in intent recognition. To address this issue, we propose a novel KBQA system based on a Large Language Model(LLM) and BERT (LB-KBQA). With the help of generative AI, our proposed method could detect newly appeared intent and acquire new knowledge.

TrackGPT -- A generative pre-trained transformer for cross-domain entity trajectory forecasting,Nicholas Stroh,2024-01-29,"The forecasting of entity trajectories at future points in time is a critical capability gap in applications across both Commercial and Defense sectors. Transformers, and specifically Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) networks have recently revolutionized several fields of Artificial Intelligence, most notably Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the advent of Large Language Models (LLM) like OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this research paper, we introduce TrackGPT, a GPT-based model for entity trajectory forecasting that has shown utility across both maritime and air domains, and we expect to perform well in others. TrackGPT stands as a pioneering GPT model capable of producing accurate predictions across diverse entity time series datasets, demonstrating proficiency in generating both long-term forecasts with sustained accuracy and short-term forecasts with high precision. We present benchmarks against state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, showing that TrackGPT's forecasting capability excels in terms of accuracy, reliability, and modularity. Importantly, TrackGPT achieves these results while remaining domain-agnostic and requiring minimal data features (only location and time) compared to models achieving similar performance. In conclusion, our findings underscore the immense potential of applying GPT architectures to the task of entity trajectory forecasting, exemplified by the innovative TrackGPT model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00066v1,"cs.LG, cs.AI, 68T07"

Small LLMs Are Weak Tool Learners: A Multi-LLM Agent,"Weizhou Shen, Chenliang Li, Hongzhan Chen, Ming Yan, Xiaojun Quan, Hehong Chen, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang",2024-01-14,"Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion.

While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer.
